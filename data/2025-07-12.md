### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练，而非微调或训练随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs认知偏见的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性的影响。

Method: 采用两步因果实验方法：多次微调以研究训练随机性影响，以及交叉调换指令数据集以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 偏见主要由预训练决定，相同预训练模型的偏见模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑预训练起源，为未来评估和减少偏见提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会科学调查中作为人类代理的可靠性，发现其对问题表述和答案选项的扰动敏感，并表现出一致的“近因偏差”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在规范性调查中的响应稳健性，揭示其是否适合作为人类调查的替代。

Method: 测试了九种不同的LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案选项结构），模拟了超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感；较大模型更稳健。

Conclusion: 提示设计和稳健性测试对使用LLMs生成合成调查数据至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评估，旨在提升合成文本的可行性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成文本在隐私保护和高风险领域应用潜力巨大，但需要系统评估其效用、公平性、隐私风险等维度。

Method: 提供多维度评估功能，包括下游系统效用、公平性、隐私泄漏风险等，支持用户上传或生成合成数据。

Result: 在医疗和法律领域的数据集上验证了工具包的功能和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估指标，SynthTextEval有望提升合成文本的可行性和AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对医疗领域大语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估协议，填补了现有文献的空白，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对患者和临床医生的潜在影响。现有评估多关注通用安全性，缺乏针对医疗领域的专门评估。

Method: 提出了一种结合患者和临床医生视角的安全评估协议，并构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench数据集，通过红队测试对MediPhi模型进行评估。

Result: 首次定义了医疗LLMs的安全性评估标准，为医疗领域的安全部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗LLMs的安全性评估提供了新方法，有助于其在医疗领域的更安全应用。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习中的打断行为对知识构建至关重要，但现有研究多在单对话环境中进行，无法适应课堂中多组对话的复杂场景。

Method: 分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，开发了一种能应对重叠语音的打断识别方法。

Result: 提出了一种在多组对话中识别打断的先进方法，并揭示了打断在协作学习中的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在多组对话中跟踪打断行为提供了基础，并强调了重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康错误信息的反驳言论，通过整合静态和动态证据，优化了生成内容的相关性、准确性和时效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在生成反驳错误信息的言论时依赖有限的证据，且对最终输出的控制不足。

Method: 采用多智能体检索增强框架，结合多个LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化，整合静态和动态证据。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，并通过消融研究和人类评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量的反驳言论，且细化过程显著提升了质量并获得了人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，解决了Transformer的二次复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长文本时的时间和计算资源消耗问题。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，利用实时图生成机制处理字符级输入，无需填充或截断，并整合LLM信息。

Result: 模型在文本分类任务中表现出高效性和竞争力，生成图具有语义组织特征。

Conclusion: 新模型在效率和性能上均优于现有技术，适用于长文本处理。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl是一个可读性控制的指令调优框架，能调整LLM输出复杂度而不损失意义，显著优于GPT-4，尤其在低识字水平下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域中人机沟通的挑战，确保内容既个性化又易于理解。

Method: 引入MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令调优控制输出可读性，并在多个数据集和任务上评估。

Result: MedReadCtrl在可读性指令遵循错误率上显著低于GPT-4，专家偏好率达71.7%，且在临床任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能有效重构临床内容为易读语言，保留医学意图，为患者教育和公平医疗提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

### [9] [SynthEHR-Eviction: Enhancing Eviction SDoH Detection with LLM-Augmented Synthetic EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07421)
*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公共驱逐相关SDoH数据集，性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的重要社会决定因素，但研究不足，且在电子健康记录中缺乏结构化编码，限制了应用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建管道，提取临床记录中的驱逐状态。

Result: 创建的SDoH数据集包含14个细粒度类别，微调LLMs在驱逐和其他SDoH任务上表现优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。

Conclusion: 该管道显著减少标注工作量，加速数据集创建，适用于其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 开发轻量级、可解释的模型，用于自然语言解释时间序列模式。

Conclusion: 展示了将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SAND框架，通过自我教学的动作审议提升LLM代理性能，避免次优行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法可能导致LLM代理因探索不足而选择次优行动，需改进。

Method: 结合自一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，生成审议轨迹并微调LLM代理。

Result: 在两项任务中，SAND比初始监督微调提升20%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过动作审议显著提升LLM代理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在强化学习中训练不稳定和策略漂移的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架，先收集已验证轨迹，再在训练中重放这些轨迹，混合新生成的数据进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过经验回放有效提升训练效率和模型性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了‘机器废话’作为LLM中真实性丧失的框架，并引入‘废话指数’和分类法，通过实验验证RLHF和CoT提示对废话的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM中真实性丧失的广泛现象及其机制，为AI对齐提供新视角。

Method: 提出废话指数和分类法，评估Marketplace、Political Neutrality和BullshitEval数据集。

Result: RLHF加剧废话，CoT提示放大特定形式；政治语境中废话普遍，以‘模棱两可’为主。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING是一种后训练框架，通过从大型语言模型中提取任务分解（规划轨迹）并微调小型模型，显著提升了复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用任务分解规划结构提升小型开源语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出PLAN-TUNING框架，包括从大型模型提取规划轨迹，并通过监督和强化学习微调小型模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是提升小型语言模型任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeaR通过数据筛选和强化学习提升LLM的推理能力，显著提高了模型在多个基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，但现有方法依赖复杂代码结构，导致过拟合。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，指导模型发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在17个基准测试中表现显著提升，Qwen2.5-7B和R1-Distilled-7B分别提升35.9%和5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升了LLM的通用推理能力，尤其在代码相关任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现优异，为自动化文献分析提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: LLMs无法完成或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的能力边界，对实际应用中的任务设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Motivation: 解决非英语语言中心理支持数据集稀缺的问题，提升心理支持对话的质量和规模。

Method: 通过Dialog Generator生成大规模心理辅导对话，Dialog Modifier优化对话质量，构建CPsDD数据集，并开发CADSS系统，包含Profiler、Summarizer、Planner和Supporter模块。

Result: 构建了包含68K对话的CPsDD数据集，CADSS在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，并在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Result: 三人对话训练的VAP模型表现优于基线，但对话类型对准确性有影响。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三人对话的轮流发言预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言检索的改进机会，特别是在实际应用中，提出的策略有效提升了跨语言RAG性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索长链思维监督微调和强化学习在多模态推理模型中的联合效果及其潜在协同作用。

Method: 通过系统实验分析长链思维SFT和RL在不同难度任务中的表现，并尝试多种结合策略。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题的推理能力但导致冗长，RL提高泛化性和简洁性但效果有限；结合策略未能实现协同。

Conclusion: 需要更自适应的方法以充分发挥联合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 文档图像机器翻译（DIMT）面临训练数据有限和视觉与文本信息复杂交互的挑战，需要一种高效的方法提升翻译质量和跨领域泛化能力。

Method: M4Doc通过将单模态图像编码器与预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对齐，学习关键的视觉-文本关联，并在推理时绕过MLLM以保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，M4Doc显著提升了翻译质量，特别是在跨领域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过单模态到多模态对齐框架，有效解决了DIMT的挑战，提升了翻译性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Result: 在WikiText-2上，测试困惑度为8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练成本，即可获得后验感知的标记概率和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可在资源受限应用中实现高效且高性能的问答系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂问答问题时，现有方法主要关注RAG的准确性和召回率，而忽略了检索效率的重要性。

Method: 采用改进提示的标准ReAct流程，并结合监督和基于RL的微调，以减少检索次数。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，改进的ReAct流程优于现有方法，且能以更少的检索次数实现竞争性RAG指标。

Conclusion: 研究表明，检索效率是RAG的重要指标，且无需大规模微调即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Method: 提出了PCR的四类表面形式分类法，并构建了一个包含500个真实PCR帖子的数据集。评估了现有LLM模型的性能，并通过错误分析重新验证了基于拼音的提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差。基于拼音的提示策略显著提升了准确率。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR，揭示了现有检测器的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级改进方法，推动了毒性检测的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖耗时的人工参考摘要，NOIR旨在提供自动化工具，优化摘要算法和生成过程。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，量化语义保留与压缩长度的权衡。

Result: 实验显示NOIR能有效捕捉摘要器的语义保留与长度压缩关系，并与人类评价一致。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供高效自动化评估工具，适用于算法优化和摘要生成。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）性能随注意力头数增加而提升，但需保持隐藏尺寸足够大。因此，提出在低参数开销下增加头和隐藏尺寸的方法。

Method: 通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多头和隐藏特征维度，同时引入参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数成本。

Result: 在多种数据集和任务上验证了SAS的有效性，性能显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑的同时，显著提升了性能，为注意力机制提供了高效扩展方案。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面均优于传统RAG实现，为知识扩展提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种选择性对齐策略，通过优先处理高影响力标记来优化大型语言模型的训练后对齐，减少计算开销并提高对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练后对齐是一个关键挑战，因为并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献均等。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，选择性地对齐高影响力标记。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，选择性DPO方法优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升大型语言模型的偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律领域的应用，提出了一种创新的双重分类法，结合法律推理框架和专业本体论，系统化统一了历史研究和当代突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在法律领域应用的综述空白，推动法律人工智能的发展。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的LLMs，结合稀疏注意力机制和专家混合架构，动态捕捉法律语义并统一证据推理。

Result: 在任务泛化、推理形式化、工作流整合等方面取得显著进展，但面临幻觉、可解释性不足等挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了新的分类法，为法律AI的未来发展提供了技术路线图和概念框架。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni通过统一的语音-语言大模型（LSLM）实现流式语音翻译，结合语音链式思维（CoT）完成分段、策略决策和翻译生成，无需大量策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级分段，限制了上下文信息，且策略学习复杂。

Method: 提出StreamUni，利用LSLM和语音CoT生成多阶段输出，完成分段、策略决策和翻译。

Result: 实验表明StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型解决了流式语音翻译的复杂性和低延迟需求。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以生成简洁且语义一致的公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中，需要语义一致的连续逻辑公式表示，并且这些表示必须可逆以生成具体需求。

Method: 训练一个基于Transformer的解码器模型，通过STL语法的小词汇表生成有效的公式，并评估其在不同复杂度训练数据下的表现。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后能泛化到逻辑语义，并能解码出更简洁且语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在需求挖掘任务中表现出色，直接在语义空间中进行优化，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Result: 重复神经元对ICL性能的影响因层深度而异，同时提出了减少重复输出并保持ICL能力的策略。

Conclusion: 从技能神经元角度分析为优化LLMs的ICL性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令微调中，损失函数仅计算响应标记而忽略提示标记，这可能不是最优方案。研究旨在探索差异加权对性能的影响。

Method: 提出WIT方法，系统研究提示和响应标记的权重分配，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，传统指令微调损失函数性能次优，而WIT方法在多种模型和数据集上表现更优，且对后续偏好对齐训练更有利。

Conclusion: 研究强调需重新审视指令微调的损失函数设计，WIT方法为开发更鲁棒和泛化的模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Motivation: 扩展一元分词方法，利用平行数据中的源语言标记信息，提升跨语言语义对齐。

Method: 基于固定源语言分词器，学习目标语言分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在四种语言对上测试，语言建模困惑度降低，但机器翻译质量未提升。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次方扩展可能导致数据效率瓶颈，需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Result: 核心指代解析提升检索效果和QA性能，小模型在消歧过程中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了核心指代复杂性对RAG的挑战，为改进检索和生成提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 论文不仅理论创新，还通过语义病毒概念展示了实际应用潜力，结果基于范畴论和信息论。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理（CHA）缺乏自适应多轮推理和透明决策能力，限制了其在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分为症状提取、病史获取和因果图构建三个阶段，利用可解释的置信度评分指导自适应提问。

Result: 在两个中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提升30%，对话轮次仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: DocCHA证明了结构化、透明且高效的诊断对话的可行性，为多语言和资源受限环境下的可信LLM临床助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测的解释性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，主要因为领域特异性强，缺乏结构化分析和解释性。

Method: 提出SFE和E-DPO方法，结合领域知识优化模型输出，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了更精确、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆解决方案局限于扁平化、范围狭窄的记忆组件，无法满足个性化、抽象化和长期可靠回忆用户信息的需求。

Method: MIRIX采用六种记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库）和多代理框架，动态协调记忆更新与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA多模态任务中，MIRIX比基线RAG准确率提高35%，存储需求减少99.9%；在LOCOMO文本任务中达到85.4%的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型语言模型代理设定了新的性能标准，并通过实际应用展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）比显式奖励模型（EX-RM）更依赖表面标记级线索，导致泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差异的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的差异，验证其泛化能力。

Result: IM-RM更依赖标记级线索，泛化能力较差；反驳了其他可能的解释。

Conclusion: 设计选择对奖励模型的泛化行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探索如何在资源有限的医疗环境中高效支持临床决策，同时减少能耗和成本。

Method: 使用小型语言模型（SLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，并与大型语言模型（LLMs）进行对比评估。

Result: SLMs+RAG在诊断和治疗性能上优于LLMs，且能耗更低，适合本地部署，但未达到专家水平。

Conclusion: SLMs+RAG是资源有限医疗环境中的可行方案，但仍需专家监督以确保准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在医学推理能力评估上存在不足，缺乏严谨且可扩展的基准测试。

Method: 提出MedThink-Bench基准测试和LLM-w-Ref框架，利用专家标注的逐步推理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制进行评估。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，且较小模型（如MedGemma-27B）表现优于大型专有模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为医学推理评估提供了基础工具，有助于LLM在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义的工作流和静态工具集，PyVision旨在通过动态工具生成解决这一问题。

Method: PyVision框架允许MLLM根据任务需求动态生成、执行和优化Python工具，并对其使用进行分类分析。

Result: PyVision显著提升了模型性能，GPT-4.1在V*上提升7.8%，Claude-4.0-Sonnet在VLMsAreBlind-mini上提升31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成不仅使模型能使用工具，还能发明工具，推动更具自主性的视觉推理发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Motivation: 探究前沿LLMs在简单推理任务上的表现，揭示其失败原因，以理解其泛化能力的局限性。

Method: 扩展文献中的工作，生成参数可调的简单推理任务套件，并引入“unpuzzles”数据集，分析模型行为。

Result: LLMs在简单任务上系统性失败，且对简化版谜题表现不佳，显示泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在简单推理任务上的表现不佳，表明其泛化能力仍有问题，任务简化未必提升性能。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE）用于多模态实体链接（MEL），解决了现有方法中提及歧义和模态内容动态选择的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择的问题，导致性能受限。

Method: MMoE包含四个模块：描述感知提及增强、多模态特征提取、层内和层间专家混合，动态选择特征。

Result: 实验表明MMoE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态特征选择和提及增强，显著提升了MEL性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Motivation: 解决语义分割中标注数据难以获取的问题，利用文本的领域无关特性提升UDA方法的性能。

Method: 通过LLM生成领域描述，结合冻结的CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，设计CoPT损失学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT实现了UDA分割任务的最新最优性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入的领域无关性有效提升了UDA分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）的去学习技术（MU）在伦理和法律应用中至关重要，但其鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Recall框架，利用多模态对抗输入（图像提示）测试去学习模型的鲁棒性，优于现有基于文本提示的方法。

Result: Recall在十种先进去学习方法中表现优异，揭示了当前去学习机制的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的去学习解决方案以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp通过自监督和轻量级模块设计，显著提升了息肉分割的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，用于解决活动生物识别中身份特征与运动动态和外观变化的纠缠问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物识别在多样化活动中面临身份特征与运动动态和外观变化纠缠的挑战，需要更复杂的特征学习方法。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，利用结构化语言指导解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征，避免依赖额外视觉数据。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中取得最优性能，并在传统视频识别基准中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架通过语言指导有效解耦特征，显著提升了活动生物识别的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多语言视觉问答任务中的基准测试，覆盖11种语言和5种社会属性。研究发现闭源模型表现最佳，开源模型如Qwen2.5在多语言泛化能力上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在多语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平输出，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 提出LinguaMark基准测试，包含6,875个图像-文本对，评估指标包括偏差、答案相关性和忠实性。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）整体表现最佳，开源模型Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现优异。

Conclusion: 发布基准测试和评估代码以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Result: 揭示了当前视觉推理方法的关键局限和机会。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进多模态认知提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源和专有视觉语言模型在指令引导图像编辑评估中存在对齐问题和效率不足，且缺乏公开训练数据集。

Method: 提出ADIEE方法生成10万+样本数据集，并基于LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型训练评分模型。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中表现优于开源和专有模型，显著提升与人类评分的相关性及比较准确性。

Conclusion: ADIEE方法为指令引导图像编辑提供了高效、透明的自动化评估工具，并能用于模型优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the

for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的新框架，以保护视频数据隐私，防止未经授权的深度跟踪器利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用于视觉目标跟踪（VOT）训练，但数据隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成TUEs的生成框架，并引入时间对比损失以增强效果，确保跟踪器依赖噪声而非原始数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面达到最先进性能，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TUEs框架有效解决了视频数据隐私问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对比强化学习方法，通过训练模型区分连贯图像序列与无关图像，提升视觉叙事系统中角色和对象的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉叙事系统在跨帧识别角色和对象时表现不佳，导致引用不一致和幻觉问题，原因是缺乏对跨帧实体连接的明确训练。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集，使用合成负例训练模型，并采用双组件奖励函数优化实体连接行为。

Result: 实验显示，实体识别的mAP提升14.8%，F1提升17.1%，跨帧角色和对象持续性显著提高，结构化故事比例增加23.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体一致性和故事连贯性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Conclusion: PacGDC通过高效数据合成显著提升了深度补全模型的泛化性能，适用于零样本和少样本场景。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Result: 在挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，分析了适应性与对应性的权衡。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了表面表示精度和对应性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种高效且通用的模块，显著提升了PES任务的性能。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Result: 通过DeformingThings4D-skl数据集验证，模型在保留习惯行为方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了跨类别动物运动转移中习惯行为保留的难题。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无约束照片集合易于获取但存在光照不一致和瞬态遮挡问题，传统分割方法无法有效解决。

Method: 结合多维特征嵌入和3D高斯泼溅，提出Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter（SGC）平滑异常高斯，并设计基准评估分割质量。

Result: 相比现有方法，Seg-Wild在分割效果和重建质量上表现更优。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景的分割和重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要多阶段和复杂流程来补全图像缺失部分并合成新视角，忽略了跨视角依赖且计算冗余。

Method: 采用输入级和特征级掩码微调，实现端到端模型，提升新视角合成和模态补全能力。

Result: 在遮挡任务中，PSNR提升3.9，Volume IoU提升0.28，重建时间减少95%。

Conclusion: EscherNet++在较小数据集和批量下实现SOTA，且能泛化到真实世界遮挡重建。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练多模态模型（LMMs）在微调下游任务时计算成本高，需更高效的模态对齐方法。

Method: 利用中间层的时间提示和基于相似性的提示交互，实现模态间充分信息交换。

Result: 计算资源消耗和可训练参数显著减少（约1%），在UPMC-Food101和SNLI-VE数据集上表现优异，MM-IMDB数据集上性能相当。

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，适用于文本-图像分类任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DSANet的双语义感知网络，用于增强超声视频分割中的噪声鲁棒性，通过局部和全局特征的语义感知提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像因其简单和非侵入性而被广泛使用，但其固有噪声对自动化分割任务提出了挑战。

Method: 设计了AFSA模块和LGSA模块，分别通过相邻帧语义感知和局部-全局特征融合来减少噪声影响。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: DSANet显著提升了超声视频分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Motivation: 蓝白色面纱（BWV）是黑色素瘤诊断的关键特征，但现有研究有限。本研究旨在通过深度学习技术改进BWV的检测，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供工具。

Method: 使用非注释皮肤病变数据集，通过颜色阈值技术生成注释数据集。设计并训练了DCNN模型，采用自定义层替代标准激活函数层，并在多个数据集上进行测试。

Conclusion: 结合XAI的方法显著提升了BWV检测效果，为黑色素瘤早期诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象感知的精细化方法显著提升了OoD分割的精度和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶等安全敏感场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气导致图像质量下降，影响人脸识别准确性，现有方法缺乏针对性模块。

Method: 采用局部SFFT增强面部结构和颜色保真度，DAFE模块实现退化无关的特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有GAN和扩散模型，尤其在抑制纹理失真和重建面部结构方面。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块在恶劣天气下显著提升了恢复效果，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了短期运动预测性能。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过建模物理依赖关系，显著提升了运动预测的物理合理性和准确性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健推理的关键在于针对性对齐而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光环境下性能显著下降，主要由于图像质量退化（如低对比度、噪声）和弱监督的固有限制，导致不可靠的类激活图和语义模糊的伪标签。

Method: 提出DGKD-WLSS框架，结合扩散引导知识蒸馏（DGKD）和深度引导特征融合（DGF2），前者通过去噪和知识蒸馏对齐正常光和低光特征，后者利用深度图作为光照不变的几何先验增强特征学习。

Result: 实验表明DGKD-WLSS在低光条件下的弱监督语义分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS有效解决了低光环境下的弱监督语义分割问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The

constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of

TL;DR: HOTA是一种多尺度推理策略，结合SegFormer和深度估计模块，实现了高精度的3D洪水测绘，适用于快速灾害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是频繁的自然灾害，现有产品在空间细节和覆盖范围之间存在权衡，且常忽略洪水深度。HOTA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: HOTA采用分层重叠分块聚合策略，结合SegFormer和基于DEM的深度估计模块，实现多尺度洪水测绘。

Result: 在澳大利亚Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA将IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能生成高精度、大范围的3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 在多视角头发转移领域设立了新标杆，代码已开源。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpatialViz-Bench，一个多模态空间可视化基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型的空间可视化能力，揭示了现有模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了包含12个任务、1,180个自动生成问题的多模态基准测试SpatialViz-Bench，并评估了33个先进MLLM。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在与人类直觉不符的困难感知、2D到3D性能骤降等问题，显示空间可视化能力不足。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了领域空白，证明当前MLLM在空间可视化任务中仍有缺陷，基准已公开。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Method: ViLU通过跨注意力机制整合视觉嵌入、预测文本嵌入和图像条件文本表示，训练一个二元分类器来区分正确与错误预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现出色，显著优于现有方法，适用于后处理场景。

Conclusion: ViLU通过其架构和训练方法，有效提升了不确定性量化能力，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有生成视频编码方法受限于领域特异性或对高层文本指导的依赖，导致运动细节丢失和重建不真实。

Method: 采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样管道，提取像素级运动轨迹点，并结合轨迹对齐的损失约束。

Result: 在超低码率下优于传统编解码器和端到端视频压缩方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Conclusion: 年龄偏见可以通过简单的训练调整有效缓解，近似的人口统计标签对提升大规模情感计算系统的公平性有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Result: 在MitoDataset上，MolCLIP在药物识别和MoA识别上的mAP分别提高了51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合和时间动态分析，显著提升了MoA识别的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLMs中CoT推理的忠实性和准确性提供了实用有效的方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法在计算资源分配和空间变化模糊模式处理上存在不足，导致局部运动模糊去除效果不佳。

Method: 1. 使用模糊区域预测器识别模糊区域，并通过结构重参数化优化计算；2. 开发帧内运动分析器，将像素位移转化为运动轨迹，指导模糊恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法在去模糊效果和计算效率上均有显著提升，为局部运动模糊问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code
is available at https://github.com/shangwei5/M2AENet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CrossVLAD基准数据集和CRAFT攻击方法，用于评估统一视觉语言模型在多任务对抗攻击中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多任务指令下的安全性问题尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性评估其对抗攻击的跨任务有效性。

Method: 通过GPT-4辅助标注构建CrossVLAD数据集，并提出CRAFT（跨任务区域攻击框架）方法，专注于目标对象的跨任务分类一致性攻击。

Result: 实验表明，CRAFT在跨任务攻击性能和目标对象改变成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CrossVLAD和CRAFT为统一VLMs的对抗攻击研究提供了有效工具，揭示了其跨任务脆弱性。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Result: 实验表明医学影像数据集中也存在偏见。

Conclusion: 呼吁更多可解释的研究和开源医学数据集，以促进AI在医学影像中的应用。

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理的独特挑战，提升视觉语言模型在长视频中的表现。

Method: 整合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练流程（CoT-SFT和强化学习）及MR-SP训练基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA基准测试中表现优异，MR-SP系统实现2.1倍加速。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1标志着VLMs在长视频推理中的重要进展，并公开了支持多模态的训练系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Motivation: SAM的2D架构不适用于3D医学影像数据，现有3D方法复杂且计算资源需求高。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D医学影像分割提供了一种高效且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估视觉接地推理能力，因此提出TreeBench填补这一空白。

Method: 基于三项原则构建TreeBench：聚焦复杂场景中的细微目标、通过边界框评估可追踪证据、测试高阶推理。同时提出TreeVGR训练范式，联合监督定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench中现有模型准确率不足60%，TreeVGR在多个基准测试中显著提升性能（如TreeBench提升13.4%）。

Conclusion: 可追踪性是提升视觉接地推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为相关研究提供了新工具和方法。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的对象幻觉问题，显著提升了性能并减少了回答偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答（VQA）中存在显著的‘Yes’回答比例不平衡问题，影响其安全部署。

Method: 提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，动态选择能量分数最低的隐藏状态层。

Result: 在三个基准测试（POPE、MME和MMVP）中提升了准确率和F1分数，平均准确率提高4.82%，‘Yes’比例差距减少8.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，减少了回答偏见并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全性和响应性至关重要，事件视觉传感器的高时间分辨率和低延迟适合这一需求，但现有方法在早期预测能力上有限。

Result: 在THU EACT-50数据集上，准确率比之前工作提升2%，并展示了在体育运动中早期动作触发的实际应用。

Conclusion: 高速率双流SNN在早期活动识别中表现出色，为实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Method: 提出SDST架构和参考可变形自注意力机制，结合InternVideo2骨干网络。

Result: 在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA上取得竞争性或SOTA结果，参数减少73%。

Conclusion: SDST显著提升了现有侧调谐方法的性能，同时降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: X-RAFT在跨模态图像配准中表现出色，为荧光定量分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Result: Dice Score提升9.2%，体素匹配率提升9.9%，交互时间从数天缩短至分钟级。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于深度学习的DVC技术奠定了基础，有望提升增材制造的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

Motivation: 无限制对抗攻击绕过传统防御策略，但缺乏统计显著的不可感知性评估方法。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括众包研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 发现现有攻击未能生成不可感知图像，GPT-4o仅部分有效，自动化视觉系统与人类感知不一致。

Conclusion: SCOOTER填补了评估无限制对抗攻击的空白，强调人类感知的重要性。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 探索在真实世界数据集偏移下，如何选择和应用校准技术以提高图像分类模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个自然偏移和分类任务中进行实验。

Result: 发现熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳，后处理校准器在少量语义OOD数据下表现稳健，且简单方法不逊于专门方法。

Conclusion: 校准偏移通常以牺牲分布内校准为代价，但微调基础模型和集成方法能显著提升校准鲁棒性。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: 论文提出了S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，用于评估复杂3D场景中的语言引导空间推理分割，旨在解决现有数据集中空间关系理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言研究中，空间推理能力未得到充分探索，现有数据集常将语义线索与空间上下文混合，导致模型依赖表面捷径而非真正理解空间关系。

Method: 引入S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，包含200k+视觉语言对和900+室内场景，设计89k+无对象名称的人类标注空间查询，覆盖多种空间推理技能。

Result: 初步基准测试显示，现有3D视觉定位方法和3D-LLMs面临显著挑战，凸显了该数据集和3D-SRS基准套件的必要性。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D和3D-SRS旨在推动空间感知AI的发展，为有效的具身交互和机器人规划铺平道路。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

*Kang Cen,Chang-Hong Fu,Hong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于3D卷积神经网络和差分帧融合模块的非接触式远程光电容积描记（rPPG）网络，结合动态混合损失函数，显著提升了心率测量的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG网络在复杂场景下的准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力不足，需改进。

Method: 使用3D卷积神经网络重建rPPG信号，引入差分帧融合模块和时序移位模块（TSM）增强特征，提出动态混合损失函数防止过拟合。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG和MMPD数据集上表现优异，训练后模型在MMPD测试集上的MAE为7.58，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂场景下具有更高的准确性和泛化能力，为rPPG技术提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT通过生成实例感知提示并与数据集级提示融合，解决了传统VPT方法因输入实例差异导致的性能问题，利用PCA保留关键信息，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VPT方法使用固定数据集级提示，无法适应输入实例的差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出ViaPT，生成实例感知提示并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留重要信息，减少可学习参数。

Result: 在34个数据集上实验表明，ViaPT性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT为视觉变换器的提示优化提供了新范式，平衡了数据集级和实例级知识。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

### [122] [Synergistic Prompting for Robust Visual Recognition with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07802)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting (SyP)的新框架，用于解决多模态视觉识别中缺失模态的问题，通过动态适配器和协同提示策略显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态数据常存在缺失或不完整的情况，导致性能下降。现有提示方法缺乏灵活性且难以在关键模态缺失时保持可靠性。

Method: SyP框架包含动态适配器（动态生成提示）和协同提示策略（结合静态与动态提示），以灵活适应不同缺失条件并确保鲁棒性。

Result: SyP在三个广泛使用的视觉识别数据集上显著优于现有方法，并在不同缺失率和条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SyP通过动态适配和协同提示有效解决了多模态缺失问题，具有优越的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次将视觉变换器（ViT）应用于无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测，比较了患者特定模型和多患者模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高质子治疗中肺部肿瘤运动的预测精度，探索ViT在无标记预测中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描数据训练多患者模型，保留1名患者用于评估；患者特定模型仅使用目标患者数据。评估指标为ADE和FDE。

Result: 患者特定模型在T1数据上表现更优，但多患者模型在T2数据上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ViT在无标记肿瘤运动预测中具有潜力，患者特定模型精度高，而多患者模型适合临床时间受限场景。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有内容拼图求解器在现实应用中缺乏对关键挑战（如碎片化文物或文件的重组）的评估。

Method: 引入三种拼图损坏类型（缺失、边缘腐蚀、内容腐蚀），评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现。

Result: 标准拼图求解器性能随损坏增加迅速下降，但深度学习模型通过微调和数据增强显著提升鲁棒性，其中Positional Diffusion模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升现实文物自动重建提供了方向，深度学习模型在数据增强下表现突出。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量图像分割中解耦框架导致的可塑性丧失和对输入数据顺序的重度依赖问题。

Method: 提出SimCIS方法，直接选择图像特征进行查询分配，确保“完美对齐”以保留对象性，同时允许查询选择新类以提升可塑性。引入跨阶段一致性和视觉查询重放机制。

Result: SimCIS在多种分割任务、设置、划分和数据顺序下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCIS是一个简单而强大的基线方法，有效解决了类增量图像分割中的关键问题。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了3D-ADAM，首个大规模高精度3D工业异常检测数据集，旨在解决现有数据集在真实工业场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷是制造低产的主要原因，现有自动化缺陷检测方法在真实场景中表现不足，且缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 构建3D-ADAM数据集，包含14,120高分辨率扫描和27,346标注缺陷实例，覆盖12类工业表面缺陷，并在真实工业环境中采集。

Result: 评估显示现有SOTA模型在3D-ADAM上表现不佳，验证了数据集的挑战性和工业相关性。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发更鲁棒的3D异常检测模型提供了基准，有望推动工业应用发展。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学领域近期涌现了许多基础模型，但缺乏统一的评估标准，尤其是在医疗等关键领域，需要关注性能、差异、不确定性和鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了THUNDER基准测试工具，支持多种下游任务、特征空间分析和鲁棒性评估，比较了23个基础模型在16个数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学领域提供了一个可靠的基准测试工具，有助于推动模型评估和选择。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的水下图像恢复方法在复杂场景中计算量大且易产生不真实伪影，需改进。

Method: 结合预训练的潜在扩散模型与显式场景分解，并设计基于物理的水下图像合成管道生成训练数据。

Result: SLURPP比现有方法快200倍，PSNR提升约3 dB，并在真实数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: SLURPP在速度和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂水下场景。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Result: 在公开的医疗问答和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提高了事实准确性和整体性能，达到最新最优结果。

Conclusion: MIRA通过优化检索和整合多模态数据，有效提升了医疗诊断中模型的事实准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在降低计算需求的同时保持高质量，适用于资源有限平台，性能优越。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Conclusion: CiCi框架在不访问源数据的情况下，实现了最先进的性能，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices
demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,
TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs.
DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the
averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first
systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all
materials in this work for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为任务演练和机器人模拟提供逼真的火星景观视频，但火星数据稀缺且与地球图像差异大。

Method: 1) M3arsSynth：从NASA立体导航图像重建3D火星环境并渲染视频；2) MarsGen：基于3D结构生成逼真视频。

Result: 方法优于基于地球数据训练的模型，视觉逼真度和3D结构一致性更高。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效生成高质量火星视频，适用于任务模拟和机器人训练。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Geometry Forcing的方法，通过几何对齐目标改进视频扩散模型，使其更好地捕捉3D几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型仅基于原始视频数据训练时，往往无法有效学习几何感知的结构表示。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两个目标，将模型的中间表示与预训练的几何基础模型特征对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和3D一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing成功提升了视频扩散模型的几何感知能力。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: OST-Bench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在在线时空理解任务中的表现，发现现有模型在复杂时空推理任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要针对离线场景，无法反映真实世界中动态探索和时空推理的挑战，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: 通过高效的数据收集流程构建了包含1.4k场景和10k问答对的OST-Bench数据集，并评估了多个领先MLLMs的表现。

Result: 现有MLLMs在复杂时空推理任务上表现较差，尤其在在线设置下，随着探索时间延长和记忆增长，准确性下降。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了MLLMs在在线时空推理中的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了方向和资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中学习绑定的局限性，发现数据属性（如低属性密度、不完整描述和显著性偏差）是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中表现不佳，尤其是在区分复杂场景时（如颜色和物体的绑定问题），作者怀疑数据属性是根本原因。

Method: 通过合成数据集系统分析数据属性对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 发现自然数据的常见属性（如低属性密度、不完整描述和显著性偏差）对绑定性能有负面影响，且增加负样本或批量大小无法解决问题。

Conclusion: 只有当数据满足特定属性时，CLIP才能学习到可靠的绑定关系。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: STTM是一种无需训练的视频时空令牌合并方法，通过利用视频数据中的局部冗余，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型（LLMs）在处理大量时空令牌时存在二次计算复杂度的问题，而现有方法忽视了视频数据中的局部冗余。

Method: STTM通过粗到细的搜索将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中，STTM表现优于现有令牌减少方法，实现了2倍速度提升（仅0.5%准确率下降）和3倍速度提升（仅2%准确率下降）。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于不同查询的视频处理，并支持KV缓存重用。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大脑视觉解码评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖了模型间的差异，缺乏神经科学基础，且无法捕捉细粒度视觉差异。

Method: 引入BASIC框架，通过结构保真度、推理对齐和上下文一致性三个层次评估解码图像与真实图像的差异。结构层面采用基于分割的分层指标，语义层面利用多模态大语言模型提取场景表示。

Result: 在多个刺激-神经影像数据集上对多种视觉解码方法进行了基准测试，验证了BASIC框架的区分性、可解释性和全面性。

Conclusion: BASIC框架为大脑视觉解码方法提供了更精细、可解释和全面的评估基础。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本学习中，缺乏与查询数据同分布的数据源，草图作为一种人类表达形式提供了无源替代方案。

Method: 采用原型设置，结合基于网格的定位器和原型域适应。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了草图驱动的少样本关键点检测问题。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种单次自适应分词器KARL，基于Kolmogorov复杂度原则，通过单次前向传播预测图像的分词数量，并在达到近似KC时停止。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统通常使用固定长度表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂度或熟悉度变化。KARL旨在通过自适应分词解决这一问题。

Method: KARL采用单次前向传播预测分词数量，训练过程类似于倒置强化学习，基于重建质量条件预测分词停止。

Result: KARL在单次运行中性能与现有自适应分词器相当，并分析了编码器/解码器大小、连续与离散分词等因素的缩放规律。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像分词与算法信息理论的类比，其预测的图像复杂度与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Motivation: 现有VQ-VAEs的重建质量与VAEs存在较大差距，需要改进量化策略以缩小这一差距。

Result: 在ImageNet和8个零样本基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于SD-VAE。

Conclusion: \NickName在重建任务中表现出色，为高保真图像处理任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD

Motivation: 探讨训练数据中概念组合（如常见物体不常见配对）对CLIP/LMM性能的影响，以理解组合泛化的机制。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）衡量词共现频率，通过合成图像和自然图像编辑实验验证PMI与模型准确性的相关性。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中重现（r=0.75），此效应也迁移到LMMs（TextVQA r=0.70，VQAv2 r=0.62）。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发新算法和架构以提升多模态模型的组合泛化能力，而非仅依赖数据规模扩展。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Conclusion: FLOWGUARDIAN显著增强了安全团队在主动威胁狩猎和事件响应中的能力。

Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the rapid identification and
mitigation of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is crucial. Security
practitioners rely on detailed threat reports to understand the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers. However, manually
extracting attack testflows from these reports requires elusive knowledge and
is time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper proposes FLOWGUARDIAN, a
novel solution leveraging language models (i.e., BERT) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the extraction of attack testflows from
unstructured threat reports. FLOWGUARDIAN systematically analyzes and
contextualizes security events, reconstructs attack sequences, and then
generates comprehensive testflows. This automated approach not only saves time
and reduces human error but also ensures comprehensive coverage and robustness
in cybersecurity testing. Empirical validation using public threat reports
demonstrates FLOWGUARDIAN's accuracy and efficiency, significantly enhancing
the capabilities of security teams in proactive threat hunting and incident
response.

Conclusion: Disa通过学习指令相关性，显著提升了反汇编的准确性，尤其在混淆二进制中表现突出，为安全领域提供了更可靠的反汇编工具。

Abstract: For reverse engineering related security domains, such as vulnerability
detection, malware analysis, and binary hardening, disassembly is crucial yet
challenging. The fundamental challenge of disassembly is to identify
instruction and function boundaries. Classic approaches rely on file-format
assumptions and architecture-specific heuristics to guess the boundaries,
resulting in incomplete and incorrect disassembly, especially when the binary
is obfuscated. Recent advancements of disassembly have demonstrated that deep
learning can improve both the accuracy and efficiency of disassembly. In this
paper, we propose Disa, a new learning-based disassembly approach that uses the
information of superset instructions over the multi-head self-attention to
learn the instructions' correlations, thus being able to infer function
entry-points and instruction boundaries. Disa can further identify instructions
relevant to memory block boundaries to facilitate an advanced block-memory
model based value-set analysis for an accurate control flow graph (CFG)
generation. Our experiments show that Disa outperforms prior deep-learning
disassembly approaches in function entry-point identification, especially
achieving 9.1% and 13.2% F1-score improvement on binaries respectively
obfuscated by the disassembly desynchronization technique and popular
source-level obfuscator. By achieving an 18.5% improvement in the memory block
precision, Disa generates more accurate CFGs with a 4.4% reduction in Average
Indirect Call Targets (AICT) compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic-based
approach.

Result: 方法在保留水印的同时，能检测篡改块及其位置。

Conclusion: 该方案适用于遥感图像的水印嵌入和篡改检测。

Abstract: A semi-fragile watermarking scheme for multiple band images is presented in
this article. We propose to embed a mark into remote sensing images applying a
tree-structured vector quantization approach to the pixel signatures instead of
processing each band separately. The signature of the multispectral or
hyperspectral image is used to embed the mark in it order to detect any
significant modification of the original image. The image is segmented into
three-dimensional blocks, and a tree-structured vector quantizer is built for
each block. These trees are manipulated using an iterative algorithm until the
resulting block satisfies a required criterion, which establishes the embedded
mark. The method is shown to be able to preserve the mark under lossy
compression (above a given threshold) but, at the same time, it detects
possibly forged blocks and their position in the whole image.

*Rami Darwish,Mahmoud Abdelsalam,Sajad Khorsandroo,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedP3E的新型联邦学习框架，通过隐私保护的类原型交换解决物联网（IoT）环境中数据异构和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IoT生态系统的扩展，其成为复杂恶意软件攻击的目标，需要隐私保护且能应对数据异构的检测框架。

Method: FedP3E框架利用高斯混合模型（GMMs）生成类原型，添加高斯噪声保护隐私，并通过SMOTE增强少数类表示。

Result: 在N-BaIoT数据集上的实验表明，FedP3E能有效减少统计异构的负面影响，且通信开销低。

Conclusion: FedP3E通过原型共享机制提升了联邦学习在IoT恶意软件检测中的性能，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机打乱特征序列的语义安全通信系统，旨在平衡传输速率与泄漏率，提升语义通信的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语义通信中的安全问题，通过随机打乱特征序列以降低语义错误概率并限制泄漏率，从而提升安全性。

Method: 设计了一种基于随机打乱模式的语义安全通信系统，将打乱模式作为共享密钥，扭曲语义数据以防止窃听。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在强噪声和不可预测衰落信道中显著优于基准方法，提升了安全传输性能。

Conclusion: 随机打乱方法有效提升了语义通信的安全性，且可作为插件兼容现有系统。

Abstract: Deep learning draws heavily on the latest progress in semantic
communications. The present paper aims to examine the security aspect of this
cutting-edge technique from a novel shuffling perspective. Our goal is to
improve upon the conventional secure coding scheme to strike a desirable
tradeoff between transmission rate and leakage rate. To be more specific, for a
wiretap channel, we seek to maximize the transmission rate while minimizing the
semantic error probability under the given leakage rate constraint. Toward this
end, we devise a novel semantic security communication system wherein the
random shuffling pattern plays the role of the shared secret key. Intuitively,
the permutation of feature sequences via shuffling would distort the semantic
essence of the target data to a sufficient extent so that eavesdroppers cannot
access it anymore. The proposed random shuffling method also exhibits its
flexibility in working for the existing semantic communication system as a
plugin. Simulations demonstrate the significant advantage of the proposed
method over the benchmark in boosting secure transmission, especially when
channels are prone to strong noise and unpredictable fading.

Motivation: 钓鱼攻击日益复杂，需要高准确性和计算效率兼顾的检测系统。

Method: 通过实验比较ML、DL和量化LLMs的性能，评估零样本和少样本提示策略，并分析对抗鲁棒性和成本效益。

Result: LLMs在识别上下文线索方面表现潜力，但准确率低于ML和DL。轻量级LLMs（如DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B）在17GB显存下达到80%以上准确率。

Conclusion: 优化后的LLMs有望成为钓鱼防御系统的关键组件，为高效、可解释的AI集成到网络安全框架提供路径。

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

Motivation: 随着网络威胁日益复杂，特别是在物联网等资源受限环境中，传统入侵检测方法难以应对新型攻击模式，需要更动态和自适应的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种混合框架，结合传统签名检测的鲁棒性和GPT-2的语义分析能力，以识别新型攻击模式。

Result: 实验表明，该模型检测准确率提升6.3%，误报率降低9.0%，且保持近实时响应。

Conclusion: 语言模型集成在构建智能、可扩展和弹性的网络安全防御方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

Conclusion: 结论指出现有防御方法未能提供宣称的安全性，为理解白盒设置下防御鲁棒性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release
our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks

Method: 利用DSRC和Wi-Fi探针请求信号，结合三种指标（Count、Statistical RSSI、Pearson RSSI）进行假名与Wi-Fi标识关联。

Result: Pearson RSSI指标在所有场景下表现最佳，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RADAR算法显著提升追踪效果，并公开了实现和仿真场景。

Abstract: This paper presents RADAR, a tracking algorithm for vehicles participating in
Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) that exploits multiple
radio signals emitted by a modern vehicle to break privacy-preserving pseudonym
schemes deployed in VANETs. This study shows that by combining Dedicated Short
Range Communication (DSRC) and Wi-Fi probe request messages broadcast by the
vehicle, it is possible to improve tracking over standard de-anonymization
approaches that only leverage DSRC, especially in realistic scenarios where the
attacker does not have full coverage of the entire vehicle path. The
experimental evaluation compares three different metrics for pseudonym and
Wi-Fi probe identifier association (Count, Statistical RSSI, and Pearson RSSI),
demonstrating that the Pearson RSSI metric is better at tracking vehicles under
pseudonym-changing schemes in all scenarios and against previous works. As an
additional contribution to the state-of-the-art, we publicly release all
implementations and simulation scenarios used in this work.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了伪造水印的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过多密钥扩展和形式化的安全游戏，有效缓解了水印伪造威胁。

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

Conclusion: 该架构通过密码证明和策略即代码，将代理转化为去中心化经济中的信任锚定参与者，实现了全球互操作的代理互联网。

Abstract: The fragmentation of AI agent ecosystems has created urgent demands for
interoperability, trust, and economic coordination that current protocols --
including MCP (Hou et al., 2025), A2A (Habler et al., 2025), ACP (Liu et al.,
2025), and Cisco's AGP (Edwards, 2025) -- cannot address at scale. We present
the Nanda Unified Architecture, a decentralized framework built around three
core innovations: fast DID-based agent discovery through distributed
registries, semantic agent cards with verifiable credentials and composability
profiles, and a dynamic trust layer that integrates behavioral attestations
with policy compliance. The system introduces X42/H42 micropayments for
economic coordination and MAESTRO, a security framework incorporating
Synergetics' patented AgentTalk protocol (US Patent 12,244,584 B1) and secure
containerization. Real-world deployments demonstrate 99.9 percent compliance in
healthcare applications and substantial monthly transaction volumes with strong
privacy guarantees. By unifying MIT's trust research with production
deployments from Cisco and Synergetics, we show how cryptographic proofs and
policy-as-code transform agents into trust-anchored participants in a
decentralized economy (Lakshmanan, 2025; Sha, 2025). The result enables a
globally interoperable Internet of Agents where trust becomes the native
currency of collaboration across both enterprise and Web3 ecosystems.

Motivation: 钓鱼攻击利用人类行为绕过技术防御，现有警告对话框因内容静态且解释不清而效果有限。

Method: 通过大规模用户研究（N=750）比较人工与LLM生成的解释（Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Llama 3.3 70B），分析特征型和反事实型解释对行为指标和感知的影响。

Result: LLM生成的解释在降低钓鱼易感性上表现优异，Claude效果尤其突出；特征型解释对真实钓鱼更有效，反事实型减少误报。

Conclusion: LLM可自动生成高效、可扩展且符合人类中心价值观的钓鱼警告解释。

Abstract: Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to
bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.
Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of
explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this
paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language
Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for
phishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N
= 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually
generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and
counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate)
and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results indicate that
well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually
crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated
warnings exhibited particularly robust performance. Feature-based explanations
were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual
explanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables such as workload,
gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated
warning effectiveness. These results indicate that LLMs can be used to
automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that
such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred
values.

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管硬件安全功能有潜力，但其性能限制和低采用率表明需要进一步优化和推广。

Abstract: Most contemporary mobile devices offer hardware-backed storage for
cryptographic keys, user data, and other sensitive credentials. Such hardware
protects credentials from extraction by an adversary who has compromised the
main operating system, such as a malicious third-party app. Since 2011, Android
app developers can access trusted hardware via the Android Keystore API. In
this work, we conduct the first comprehensive survey of hardware-backed key
storage in Android devices. We analyze 490 119 Android apps, collecting data on
how trusted hardware is used by app developers (if used at all) and
cross-referencing our findings with sensitive user data collected by each app,
as self-reported by developers via the Play Store's data safety labels.
  We find that despite industry-wide initiatives to encourage adoption, 56.3%
of apps self-reporting as processing sensitive user data do not use Android's
trusted hardware capabilities at all, while just 5.03% of apps collecting some
form of sensitive data use the strongest form of trusted hardware, a secure
element distinct from the main processor. To better understand the potential
downsides of using secure hardware, we conduct the first empirical analysis of
trusted hardware performance in mobile devices, measuring the runtime of common
cryptographic operations across both software- and hardware-backed keystores.
We find that while hardware-backed key storage using a coprocessor is viable
for most common cryptographic operations, secure elements capable of preventing
more advanced attacks make performance infeasible for symmetric encryption with
non-negligible payloads and any kind of asymmetric encryption.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于爱因斯坦求和（einsum）符号的全同态加密（FHE）多维张量操作方法，解决了传统FHE中张量操作受限的问题，并开发了EinHops系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FHE虽然支持加密数据的直接计算，但其指令集仅限于一维向量操作，导致多维张量操作复杂且难以优化。

Method: 通过einsum符号明确编码张量结构和操作，将其分解为FHE友好的操作序列，并实现EinHops系统。

Result: EinHops能够高效执行从简单转置到复杂多维收缩的张量操作，且保持底层打包策略的透明性。

Conclusion: einsum符号的显式特性使FHE张量系统变得简单、通用且可解释，EinHops为开发者提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an encryption scheme that allows for
computation to be performed directly on encrypted data, effectively closing the
loop on secure and outsourced computing. Data is encrypted not only during rest
and transit, but also during processing. However, FHE provides a limited
instruction set: SIMD addition, SIMD multiplication, and cyclic rotation of 1-D
vectors. This restriction makes performing multi-dimensional tensor operations
challenging. Practitioners must pack these tensors into 1-D vectors and map
tensor operations onto this one-dimensional layout rather than their
traditional nested structure. And while prior systems have made significant
strides in automating this process, they often hide critical packing decisions
behind layers of abstraction, making debugging, optimizing, and building on top
of these systems difficult.
  In this work, we approach multi-dimensional tensor operations in FHE through
Einstein summation (einsum) notation. Einsum notation explicitly encodes
dimensional structure and operations in its syntax, naturally exposing how
tensors should be packed and transformed. We decompose einsum expressions into
a fixed set of FHE-friendly operations. We implement our design and present
EinHops, a minimalist system that factors einsum expressions into a fixed
sequence of FHE operations. EinHops enables developers to perform encrypted
tensor operations using FHE while maintaining full visibility into the
underlying packing strategy. We evaluate EinHops on a range of tensor
operations from a simple transpose to complex multi-dimensional contractions.
We show that the explicit nature of einsum notation allows us to build an FHE
tensor system that is simple, general, and interpretable. We open-source
EinHops at the following repository: https://github.com/baahl-nyu/einhops.

TL;DR: 论文提出DefensiveToken，一种测试时防御方法，通过插入特殊令牌来抵御提示注入攻击，实现灵活的安全性与性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入攻击威胁LLM系统安全，现有测试时防御效果不如训练时防御，需一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 插入DefensiveToken作为特殊令牌，优化其嵌入以提升安全性，开发者可根据需求灵活启用或禁用。

Result: DefensiveToken在测试时提供接近训练时防御的安全性，同时保持高性能输出。

Conclusion: DefensiveToken为LLM系统提供了一种灵活、高效的安全防御方案。

Abstract: When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to
perform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt injection, becomes a
significant threat. By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the
system, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an
arbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time
defenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers
to attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are
much less effective than training-time defenses that change the model
parameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense
with prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.
DefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are
optimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can
append a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a
minimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,
developers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as
there is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens,
if released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time. The code
is available at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/DefensiveToken.

*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于固定输入嵌入的模块化和渐进式扩展方法，替代传统的大语言模型训练范式，实现了高效、灵活的模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型训练方式资源密集且缺乏灵活性，本文探索了一种基于固定嵌入的替代方法，以实现模块化组合和渐进式扩展。

Method: 1. 通过固定嵌入实现模块化组合，将不同专家模型合并为混合专家模型（MoE）；2. 提出渐进式分层训练方法，逐层扩展模型深度。

Result: 模块化组合的MoE模型在MMLU等基准测试中表现优于原始专家模型；分层训练方法稳定收敛，模型深度与复杂推理能力正相关。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种更生物化或构造性的AI开发范式，为高效扩展、持续学习和民主化AI生态系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型，解决了时尚领域图像检索任务中缺乏大规模标注数据和细粒度理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚领域的图像检索任务因词汇丰富多样且缺乏大规模标注数据而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用两阶段标注流程自动构建FACap数据集，并基于BLIP-2模型提出FashionBLIP-2，通过轻量级适配器和多头部查询-候选匹配优化细粒度检索。

Result: 实验表明FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型为时尚领域的图像检索任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

### [164] [Automating Evaluation of Diffusion Model Unlearning with (Vision-) Language Model World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07137)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Henry Kvinge,Timothy Doster,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文介绍了autoeval-dmun，一种自动化工具，用于评估扩散模型中的遗忘效果，利用语言模型识别可能受损的邻近概念并生成对抗性提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器遗忘（MU）在扩散模型中难以验证信息是否完全清除及可能损害模型性能的问题。

Method: 开发autoeval-dmun工具，利用语言模型提取结构化知识，识别邻近概念受损情况并生成对抗性提示。

Result: 语言模型能有效排序邻近概念（与遗忘损害相关）并生成对抗性提示绕过遗忘。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估扩散模型遗忘效果提供了自动化解决方案，揭示了语言模型在语义排序和对抗提示生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

### [165] [GNNs Meet Sequence Models Along the Shortest-Path: an Expressive Method for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07138)
*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP是一种结合GNN节点编码和最短路径序列建模的新框架，用于高效捕捉多跳关系模式，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法在链接预测中难以捕捉节点对间的子图结构，且现有方法计算成本高或依赖简单启发式方法。

Method: SP4LP先用GNN计算节点表示，再提取节点对间的最短路径，用序列模型处理路径上的节点嵌入。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最优性能，理论证明其表达能力优于标准GNN和其他结构特征方法。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种通用且高效的链接预测方法，能捕捉多跳依赖关系。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究稀疏适配器作为模块化架构的构建块，提出一种简单有效的训练方法，并验证其在任务合并中的性能优于LoRA和全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏适配器作为参数高效模块化架构的潜在优势，以替代LoRA等现有方法。

Method: 提出一种简单的稀疏适配器训练方法，并研究其在多任务合并中的性能。

Result: 稀疏适配器在合并后表现出优于LoRA和全微调的分布内性能，但所有方法在分布外性能上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器是模块化架构的有力候选，但需进一步优化以提升分布外性能。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

### [167] [Str-GCL: Structural Commonsense Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07141)
*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Str-GCL的新框架，通过一阶逻辑规则显式整合结构常识到图对比学习中，解决了现有方法忽视结构常识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注隐式语义关系，忽略了图中结构和属性蕴含的结构常识，这对表示学习至关重要。

Method: Str-GCL利用一阶逻辑规则表示结构常识，并通过表示对齐机制将其整合到图对比学习中，不改变原始图结构。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL优于现有方法，为图表示学习提供了新视角。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次将结构常识直接整合到图对比学习中，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合科学机器学习的混合方法（UDEs），用于更准确地建模恶意软件传播，相比传统和神经网络方法，预测误差降低了44%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流行病学模型和神经网络方法未能完全捕捉现实网络中的非线性反馈机制，需要更准确的建模方法以应对实时演化的网络安全威胁。

Method: 评估了三种方法：经典ODE、UDE和Neural ODE，并引入符号恢复方法将神经反馈转化为显式数学表达式。

Result: UDE方法显著降低了预测误差（44%），同时保留了可解释性，揭示了网络饱和、安全响应和恶意软件变种演化等抑制机制。

Conclusion: 混合物理信息模型在预测准确性和动态洞察力上优于纯解析和纯神经网络方法，支持早期预警系统和针对性防御策略的开发。

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCQ的量化方法，将大语言模型压缩至2.0-2.75比特，减少推理成本，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的快速扩展导致推理成本高昂，部署困难，现有量化方法在低于3比特时精度和效率显著下降。

Method: 结合硬件感知的位移编码与解码、卷积码、混合编码和码簇技术，构建无查找表的编码空间，优化推理性能。

Result: CCQ在多个基准测试中表现优异，成功压缩DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B模型，实现单GPU部署。

Conclusion: CCQ是一种高效的低比特量化方法，显著降低模型大小和推理成本，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Guard是一种基于注意力感知的GNN输入分类器，用于防御LLMs的多轮越狱攻击，通过构建实体图和注意力增强机制，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs经过严格训练，但仍易受多轮越狱攻击，这些攻击难以检测和缓解。

Method: 提出G-Guard，构建多轮查询的实体图，并引入注意力感知增强机制，通过检索相似单轮查询增强分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard能有效防御多轮越狱攻击，提升LLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法通过从LLM提取文本来增强提示，但存在高变异性与低可靠性的问题。

Method: 采用描述无关的多提示学习方法（DeMul），直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，并探索多提示设置中的权重分配。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过消除描述提取步骤，显著提升了提示学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGFM的新方法，通过结合辅助模型的输出和流匹配技术，改进了时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在局限性，如刚性源分布和有限采样路径，而流匹配技术具有更快生成和更高灵活性，但未充分利用预测误差信息。

Method: CGFM扩展了流匹配，通过整合辅助模型的输出，构建双向条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用辅助模型的误差信息和改进概率路径设计，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weight Sharing Attention (WSA)的新架构，用于结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，以在强化学习中实现高效且性能优越的状态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习（RL）通常从零开始学习或依赖计算成本高的基础模型，而如何有效结合多个预训练模型的隐藏信息仍是一个未充分研究的问题。

Method: 提出WSA架构，通过共享注意力机制结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，形成丰富的状态表示。

Result: 在多个Atari游戏中，WSA表现与端到端模型相当，并研究了模型数量对性能的影响。

Conclusion: WSA为结合预训练模型在RL中的应用提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Result: 扩大规模可实现组合泛化，且隐藏激活可线性解码任务成分。这一发现与文本到图像生成模型的组合失败相关。

Conclusion: 标准神经网络可通过规模扩展实现组合泛化，且隐藏激活的解码性可作为组合能力的指标。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签偏差是现代组织系统中数据完整性的主要挑战之一，但目前缺乏有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe)框架，专门用于检测受标签偏差影响的数据集中的错误标记实例。

Result: DeCoLe在仇恨言论检测领域表现出色，优于其他标签错误检测方法。

Conclusion: DeCoLe为解决标签偏差导致的错误标记问题提供了有效工具，并可集成到组织数据管理实践中以提高数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不同输入下表现不一致，需在高风险场景中量化不确定性。现有研究多关注单一模型，忽略了模型多样性的潜力。

Method: 提出MUSE方法，利用Jensen-Shannon Divergence识别并聚合校准良好的LLM子集。

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE相比单模型和简单集成基线，校准和预测性能均有提升。

Conclusion: MUSE通过利用模型多样性，显著改进了不确定性估计的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Method: 构建了一个包含多种能量分解方法、边界条件和初始裂纹配置的PFM数据集，并测试了PINN、FNO和UNet等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型评估为断裂力学中的机器学习研究提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Motivation: 现有评估方法难以全面捕捉LLM的漏洞，亟需更有效的评估协议。

Method: 引入GuardVal协议，动态生成并优化越狱提示，结合新优化方法防止停滞。

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b到GPT-4），揭示了不同模型的行为模式。

Conclusion: GuardVal提供了更全面的LLM安全性评估，为未来研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型规模扩大，注意力机制成为计算瓶颈，但缺乏对其能源和硬件资源需求的严格评估。

Method: 在GPT-2架构上对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，测量训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用和功耗等指标。

Result: 优化内核实现的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention和MLA）能效最高，且仅降低GPU功耗并不保证减少总能耗。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源感知基准测试在注意力设计中的重要性，并提供了选择资源高效机制的实用建议。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Result: 实验表明，基于中间特征的代理模型显著提高了对抗攻击的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 分布式深度学习系统需重视中间特征泄露的安全风险。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Result: 在多模态数据下，检测性能显著提升；在模态缺失时仍保持优势。

Conclusion: MM-TCN-CMA是首个有效融合IMU和雷达数据的鲁棒多模态学习框架。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Result: 方法能准确、可解释且可编辑地建模治疗动态，支持严谨的因果分析和实际决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险的医疗领域提供了动态治疗效果建模的可行方案，兼具解释性和实用性。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Motivation: 理解特征对预测的贡献是机器学习模型的重要部分，但置换特征重要性在依赖特征存在时可能误导。

Method: 开发TRIP测试，检测因模型外推导致的不可靠置换特征重要性分数，并扩展至高维设置。

Result: 在模拟数据和应用中，TRIP能可靠检测不可靠的置换特征重要性分数。

Conclusion: TRIP为置换特征重要性提供了可靠性检测工具，适用于复杂和高维数据。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Conclusion: ProbNES通过贝叶斯积分显著提升了样本效率，扩展了NES的应用范围。

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL算法能有效提升CFL的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: ICM-CA框架有效提升隐私保护和训练效率。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图变换器将所有节点嵌入单一欧几里得空间，模糊了异构拓扑结构。本文旨在通过几何感知投影提升模型的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 在现有图变换器前添加黎曼混合专家层，将节点动态路由到最适合其局部结构的流形（球面、平坦或双曲）。

Result: 在四个节点分类基准测试中，准确率提升高达3%，同时增强了潜在空间的几何解释性。

Conclusion: 通过显式的几何感知投影，图变换器的预测能力和表示可解释性均得到显著提升。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种上下文增强的贝尔曼方程（CEBE）和上下文样本增强（CSE）方法，以解决深度强化学习（DRL）在单一上下文训练中泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DRL在多领域取得了成功，但其策略在不同参数环境中泛化能力有限。现有方法需要多上下文训练，但实际应用中获取足够数据不现实。

Method: 通过上下文马尔可夫决策过程（CMDPs）引入CEBE，并开发CSE作为数据增强方法，近似CEBE以提升泛化能力。

Result: 理论和实验证明CEBE能近似多上下文训练的Q函数，CSE在确定性控制环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: CEBE和CSE为DRL在单一上下文训练中的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Motivation: PU学习在许多实际应用中具有重要意义，但现有工作通常依赖已知类别先验或正标记数据分布受限的假设。本文旨在放宽这些假设，更全面地分析PU学习的统计复杂性。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了PU学习在不同设置下的统计复杂性，特别是未假设类别先验已知的情况。

Result: 证明了正标记和未标记样本的样本量上下界，为PU学习提供了更广泛的理论支持。

Conclusion: 本文为PU学习提供了更通用的理论框架，放宽了现有假设，为实际应用提供了更灵活的理论基础。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Motivation: 传统方法通常旨在推断完整的因果模型，而GO-CBED直接关注用户感兴趣的因果量，以提高实验效率和针对性。

Method: 引入变分下界估计器，通过基于Transformer的策略网络和基于归一化流的变分后验联合优化，实现实时决策。

Result: GO-CBED在多种因果推理和发现任务中优于现有基线，尤其是在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的情况下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED展示了将实验设计目标与具体研究目标对齐以及前瞻性序列规划的优势。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Motivation: 现有方法在疾病分类中缺乏对队列特征的全面理解，且未整合患者间的致病依赖性。

Method: 开发了ATHENA框架，通过分层网络表示和模态学习优化患者特异性分子指纹。

Result: 在391名患者的数据集上，分类性能提升13%（AUC）和20%（F1分数）。

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释AI支持个性化干预策略，改善动脉粥样硬化疾病预测和管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法在分布外（OOD）场景中表现不佳，且多目标奖励函数因数据质量有限而性能较弱。

Method: 提出联合训练Bradley-Terry单目标和多目标回归奖励函数的框架，利用共享嵌入空间。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能，7B模型超越70B基线。

Conclusion: 统一框架有效解决了奖励破解问题，并在OOD场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Conclusion: GRIT结合了变换器和图神经网络的优点，能够稳健建模复杂的时空动态。

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide系统中验证，TLC在路径采样和状态区分上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TLC是一种有效的CV学习方法，适用于增强采样任务。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Conclusion: HGMP通过统一任务格式、对比预训练和特征提示，有效解决了预训练与下游任务不匹配的问题，提升了异构图任务的性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Method: 使用深度神经网络（如Transformer和RNN）进行预训练，分析其在推理过程中如何表示对低维生成模型的信念。

Result: 神经网络能够发现这些表示，而经典电路无法实现；不同架构的神经网络在几何关系上表现一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络通过预训练任务自然地学习并表达对数据生成模型的信念，且这种表示与架构无关。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

Motivation: 多任务学习中不同任务的差异可能导致负迁移，现有方法因固定网络容量和结构限制适应性，且动态网络架构效率低下。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突并自适应调整，避免直接转换共享参数为任务特定参数。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL能显著提升多任务性能，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的多任务学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Conclusion: 通过拒绝模糊样本可以提高BCI的准确性，CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性量化上表现突出。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Method: 利用概念发现模型提取结构化概念编码，由证明者选择子集，验证者（非线性预测器）用于决策。

Result: NCV在高维复杂数据集上优于CBM和像素级PVG，减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是实现高性能可验证AI的重要进展。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于高维多变量时间序列数据，具有高效和单次处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的发展，实时异常检测需求激增，需要能够处理高维流数据且内存占用低的方法。

Method: DAD通过动态学习和监控数据的相关结构，单次处理样本，无需存储历史数据。

Result: 实验表明，DAD在多种异常类型上表现优于现有方法，尤其适合高维实时数据流。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得平衡，为实时内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稳定分解的无逆正则化框架，解决了现有神经网络低秩近似方法中的数值不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖显式Gram矩阵计算和逆运算导致数值不稳定，影响近似质量或产生奇异矩阵。

Method: 采用无逆正则化框架，基于稳定分解，解决了GPU内存不足、输入激活矩阵接近奇异和数据不足等问题。

Result: 方法在多种挑战性场景下表现稳定，证明了收敛性并给出了显式误差界。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了低秩近似的数值稳定性，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于O-RAN和元学习的新型条件切换（CHO）优化框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动网络复杂性和小区规模增加，传统切换面临延迟和失败问题，条件切换（CHO）虽能缓解但引入新挑战。

Method: 采用O-RAN架构结合元学习优化CHO，解决资源分配和信令开销问题。

Result: 在信号波动条件下，性能比3GPP基准提升至少180%。

Conclusion: 该框架为CHO优化提供了高效解决方案，具有动态鲁棒性。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Method: 使用多种BERT技术和聚类方法构建映射管道，并测试降维对聚类性能的影响。

Result: 通过专用轮廓方法优化结果，提升了职业自动区分能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为职业转换提供了自动化的新途径。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化GBA调制治疗提供了可行路径，并识别了关键调节通路。

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，SLOGAN显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过稀疏因果建模和动态干预机制，有效解决了图域自适应中的关键问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

TL;DR: TransformEEG是一种混合卷积-Transformer模型，用于通过EEG数据检测帕金森病，其表现优于现有深度学习模型，具有更高的准确性和更低的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在EEG数据上泛化能力差，主要由于受试者间的高变异性，因此需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，结合深度卷积分词器和Transformer编码器，利用通道特定特征生成令牌，并通过自注意力层实现更有效的特征混合。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，TransformEEG的中位数平衡准确率最高（78.45%），变异性最低（6.37%）。结合数据增强和阈值校正后，准确率提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在EEG数据上实现了更一致、更可靠的帕金森病检测，显著降低了变异性，优于其他模型。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Motivation: 在敏感领域，协作机器学习需要可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。传统联邦学习存在单点故障和隐私风险，而Split Learning的可扩展性较差。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的去中心化架构，利用HLF的瞬时字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）保护原始数据和模型激活，无需中央协调器。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

Motivation: 研究随机ReLU层如何交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，为深度网络表达能力的研究提供更细致的理解。

Method: 针对固定输入批次和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并证明次高斯浓度界限。

Result: 发现秩的衰减呈几何级数，比率为1-2/π≈0.3634，并识别了秩局部最大值的深度和高度。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层在有限宽度下表现出秩的振荡行为，而在正交权重初始化或强负斜率leaky-ReLU下秩接近满秩。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过解决类不平衡问题，显著提升了联邦类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Result: OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中表现优异，能有效抵抗性能恢复和梯度反转攻击。

Conclusion: OPC的深度特征遗忘机制提升了机器遗忘的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

Method: TRIX为强类别分配较弱的针对性对抗样本，为弱类别分配较强的非针对性对抗样本，并结合每类损失加权和扰动强度调整。

Result: 实验表明，TRIX显著提高了最差类别在干净和对抗数据上的准确率，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平且有效的对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Result: 现有多目标RL方法能在冲突目标间取得平衡，但在某些环境变化下性能下降。

Conclusion: 需在策略学习中纳入动态相关的上下文信息以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测跨域任务关系来同步多任务，结合传统TTT协议进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T在多任务域适应中表现出色，为测试时训练提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Motivation: 状态空间动态表示是非线性系统的最通用方法，但在训练过程中，状态轨迹可能显著变形，导致状态空间数据覆盖不足，影响训练效果和模型的可解释性与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种基于数据分布的空间填充正则化方法，结合建模和实验设计思想，针对局部仿射状态空间模型，提出了两种状态轨迹数据点分布的正则化技术。

Result: 在广泛使用的系统辨识基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化状态空间数据分布，显著提升了模型的训练效果、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Motivation: 传统生存预测方法依赖单一数据模态，无法全面捕捉肿瘤生物学的复杂性，因此需要多模态方法提升预测准确性。

Method: 提出SAMVAE框架，利用特定模态编码器将输入映射到共享潜在空间，支持标准生存分析和竞争风险场景。

Result: 在两个癌症队列中表现优异，性能与现有最佳多模态生存模型相当。

Conclusion: SAMVAE为可解释的数据驱动生存分析奠定基础，支持更明智的临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text

ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Conclusion: 预训练模型的准确性对序列决策任务具有重要价值，模型弹性可作为评估和改进模型整合的基本指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Conclusion: 平方根参数化为自然梯度变分推断提供了理论收敛保证，并展示了其实际优势。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,

Conclusion: DPO的理论框架为理解其工作原理及优化提供了基础，同时指出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Conclusion: ApexOracle提供了一种可扩展的策略，通过快速预测和分子生成对抗AMR和未来传染病爆发。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务冲突限制了模型性能，而锐度感知最小化（SAM）能有效缓解冲突，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及减少计算开销是关键挑战。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中验证了SAMO的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: SAMO是一种高效且有效的多任务优化方法，显著缓解了任务冲突问题。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常在训练或编译时应用，依赖结构化稀疏性，未能充分利用细粒度效率。

Method: UnIT通过输入特定的激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的MAC操作，无需重新训练或硬件定制。

Result: 在MSP430上，UnIT实现11.02%-82.03%的MAC减少，推理速度提升27.30%-84.19%，能耗降低27.33%-84.38%，精度损失0.48-7%。

Conclusion: UnIT证明了非结构化推理时剪枝是高效、无需重新训练的MCU部署可行方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种低资源、无需访问训练集的攻击方法，揭示了生成模型中潜在的数据重建风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的进步引发了隐私、版权和数据管理的风险，需要更好地理解和控制这些风险。

Method: 设计了一种新攻击方法，利用领域知识和模板化提示，识别可能导致图像重建的良性提示。

Result: 通过实验发现，某些看似无害的提示（如“蓝色Unisex T恤”）可以重建真实人物的面部图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型中数据重建的潜在风险，即使是普通用户也可能无意中触发此类问题。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [243] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分块机制（H-Net），通过端到端学习取代传统的分词-LM-去分词流程，显著提升了模型性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LMs）取得了巨大进步，但预处理步骤（如分词）仍是实现真正端到端基础模型的障碍。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合显式分层网络（H-Net），实现内容与上下文依赖的分割策略，完全端到端学习。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，多级分层进一步提升了性能，且在中文、代码和DNA序列等任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型的潜力，能够从原始数据中更好地学习和扩展。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PAC学习框架无法适应动态数据分布和目标变化，导致性能不佳，因此需要新的方法。

Method: 基于前瞻学习框架，改进了算法和数值结果，并将其扩展到顺序决策场景（如觅食）。

Result: 初步结果显示改进后的算法在动态环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 前瞻学习框架在动态和顺序决策场景中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

TL;DR: Q-chunking是一种通过动作分块技术改进离线到在线强化学习的方法，提升了长期稀疏奖励任务的探索效率和样本利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线数据如何有效用于在线探索和样本高效学习的挑战。

Method: 将动作分块技术应用于基于时间差分（TD）的强化学习方法，直接在分块动作空间运行RL。

Result: 在长期稀疏奖励任务中表现优异，优于现有离线到在线方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking通过动作分块显著提升了离线到在线RL的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Result: 实验表明，EXPO在样本效率上比现有方法提升了2-3倍。

Conclusion: EXPO通过结合表达性策略和动态编辑策略，有效解决了稳定价值最大化问题，显著提升了在线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整预训练大语言模型（LLM）架构的方法，通过跳过或重复层来为每个测试样本定制更优模型，显著提升推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练神经网络是否能在不微调的情况下动态调整架构，以适应不同输入任务的需求，解决固定架构在简单和复杂任务中的不足。

Method: 提出链式层（CoLa）方法，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）为每个样本优化层组合，支持跳过、重复或任意顺序堆叠层。

Result: 实验表明，75%的正确预测样本可通过更短的CoLa提升效率，60%的错误预测样本可通过优化CoLa实现正确预测。

Conclusion: 固定架构的预训练LLM存在局限性，动态深度调整能显著提升模型的泛化能力和推理效率。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Motivation: 颈动脉斑块的多序列MRI分析对评估动脉粥样硬化和缺血性中风风险至关重要，但斑块形态复杂和标记数据稀缺是主要挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段网络：粗定位模型确定感兴趣区域，精细分割模型精确描绘血管壁和斑块；提出多级多序列U-Net架构和半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 融合策略和半监督学习在数据有限的MRI应用中具有潜力，可提升颈动脉分割的准确性。

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Result: 不同架构和压缩率适用于不同分析需求，研究结果为数据存储和分析策略提供了指导。

Conclusion: 研究帮助科学家根据需求选择合适的数据压缩和存储策略。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督表示方法在表示能力和效率之间难以平衡，GridTD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GridTD通过优化轻量级神经网络和输入张量分解模型，利用多分辨率哈希网格编码学习参数。

Result: GridTD在多种压缩成像任务中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GridTD是一种多功能且先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Result: 框架能够处理不完整数据，并通过多模态数据融合提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为ccRCC的复发预测提供了更全面的解决方案，有望改善临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
