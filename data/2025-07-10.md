TL;DR: Gemini 2.X模型家族包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和2.5 Flash，以及早期的2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite。2.5 Pro在多模态理解和长上下文处理上表现卓越，而2.5 Flash以较低计算需求提供优秀推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推出Gemini 2.X模型家族，旨在覆盖模型能力与成本的全帕累托前沿，满足复杂代理问题解决的需求。

Method: 开发Gemini 2.5 Pro（高性能多模态模型）和2.5 Flash（低计算需求推理模型），以及2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite（低成本低延迟模型）。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在编码和推理基准测试中达到SoTA性能，支持3小时视频内容处理；2.5 Flash提供高效推理能力。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.X模型家族为用户提供了从高性能到低成本的全方位选择，推动了复杂代理问题解决的边界。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

### [2] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信问题，导致用户过度依赖其输出，且不同语言间的依赖行为存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在多语言环境中的安全性，尤其是其校准不足和过度自信问题，以确保全球部署时的可靠性。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对LLM输出的依赖行为。

Result: LLMs在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但不同语言的用户依赖行为存在显著差异（如日语用户更依赖不确定性表达）。

Conclusion: 多语言校准面临挑战，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

### [3] [ETT: Expanding the Long Context Understanding Capability of LLMs at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06313)
*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时面临二次计算和内存开销的问题，限制了其应用范围。

Method: ETT通过将输入上下文分块为重叠的小子序列，并在测试时高效微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 微调FFNs的第二层比全微调更有效，进一步提高了模型准确率。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型是统一形式、分布和接地语义理论的有潜力的路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了MorphScore以支持70种语言，并探讨了分词器质量与模型性能的关系，发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估分词器质量的方法尚不明确，尤其是分词器是否保留语言学上有意义的子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，并分析形态对齐分数与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明其单独不足以衡量分词器质量。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键维度，需探索其他因素。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Motivation: 研究动机在于将句法结构与数学结构（如岩浆和操作ad）联系起来，以更形式化地描述句法生成和移动规则。

Method: 方法包括将头部函数与岩浆和超岩浆结构关联，并使用彩色操作ad生成系统来描述句法对象的生成和过滤。

Conclusion: 结论是句法结构和移动规则可以通过数学结构（如彩色操作ad）形式化，从而提供更统一的框架。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

TL;DR: PERK提出了一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级模型适配器来编码长输入上下文，显著提升了长上下文推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有元学习方法在长上下文推理中内存消耗过大的问题。

Method: 使用两个嵌套优化循环：内循环将上下文编码到低秩适配器（LoRA）中，外循环学习利用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个长上下文推理任务中，PERK显著优于基线方法，性能提升最高达90%（小模型）和27%（大模型）。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗较大，但在推理时比基于提示的方法更高效，且对推理复杂性、上下文长度和信息位置更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效，现有方法依赖先验知识，实用性受限。

Method: 提出奖励引导的解码方法发现失败模式，并引入REFORM框架，通过生成对抗样本增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上显著提升鲁棒性，且不影响奖励质量。

Conclusion: REFORM框架有效提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Result: 显著提升数学推理和隐喻检测等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: LLM分解方法提高了模型透明性和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如手动主题编码）耗时且难以捕捉全球政策话语的复杂性，而DETM可以高效处理高维度数据。

Method: 使用DETM分析1995至2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，排除2020年数据。

Result: 模型揭示了政策重点从温室气体和国际公约转向实施、技术合作、能力建设和融资等新兴主题。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策话语演变的有效工具，未来可扩展到其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要问题在于视觉输入的感知能力不足。

Method: 提出PAPO方法，通过KL散度项（隐式感知损失）扩展GRPO目标，无需额外数据或外部奖励模型。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中整体提升4.4%，视觉依赖性高的任务提升接近8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RL框架提供了更深的感知监督集成，为视觉基础推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Result: 实验表明，基于合成数据训练的小型模型性能优于LLM，实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间归一化。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长序列时的高计算和内存开销问题，同时探索线性注意力在混合架构中的表现。

Method: 系统评估了六种线性注意力变体，训练了72个模型（340M和1.3B参数），并测试了五种混合比例。

Result: 发现独立表现优秀的线性模型在混合架构中未必出色，语言建模稳定性高，而召回性能在增加全注意力层后显著提升。

Conclusion: 推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet等架构，线性与全注意力比例在3:1到6:1之间，以实现高效的Transformer级召回性能。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Method: SpindleKV结合了基于注意力权重的深层缓存淘汰方法和基于码本的浅层替换策略，解决了GQA问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在两种基准测试和三种LLMs上优于基线方法，缓存缩减效果更好且性能保持稳定。

Conclusion: SpindleKV有效解决了KV缓存的内存问题，同时提升了模型性能，为LLMs推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Motivation: 行为金融学中，LLMs与投资者从众行为决策对齐的挑战在于缺乏真实用户数据用于监督微调（SFT）。

Method: 提出InvestAlign框架，利用理论解决方案生成SFT数据集，而非依赖复杂场景的真实数据。

Result: 实验表明，使用InvestAlign生成的数据训练LLMs参数收敛更快，且微调后的InvestAgent模型更接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: InvestAlign为解决复杂投资问题和LLMs对齐投资者决策行为提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

### [19] [The Flaws of Others: An LLM-driven Framework for Scientific Knowledge Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565)
*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）视为平等节点的网络模型，定义了四种无效性风险，并开发了一种数学模型和开源算法（FOO）来提高网络中的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过将人类与LLMs纳入平等交流的网络中，解决LLMs中的无效性问题（如幻觉、逻辑错误等），以提高信息的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种基于网络的模型，将人类和LLMs视为节点，跟踪信息传播；定义了四种无效性风险（漂移、自我修复、新捏造、外部检测），并开发了数学模型和FOO算法（一种可配置的互评机制）。

Result: 数学模型显示，仅包含漂移和自我修复的网络会稳定在较低错误率；加入新捏造后错误率升高；引入外部检测（如互评）可显著提高真实性。FOO算法实现了这一机制。

Conclusion: 提高信息可靠性的关键在于将不完美的模型纳入互评网络，而非追求单一模型的完美。FOO算法为这一目标提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多模态知识图谱（MMKG）与生成式AI的食品领域QA框架，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合结构化知识与多模态生成，提高食品领域问答系统的可靠性和多样性。

Method: 构建大规模MMKG，生成QA对，联合微调Meta LLaMA和Stable Diffusion模型，并采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率94.1%，合成充分性85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成相结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性和多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit (GMU)的机制，用于在SSM层之间高效共享内存，并基于此构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，以提升序列建模的性能和效率。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba和YOCO的优势，实现内存共享和高效解码。

Result: SambaY在解码效率、长上下文性能和可扩展性上显著优于基线模型，并在推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY为高效序列建模提供了新思路，展示了在大规模计算环境下的优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 引入FuDoBa，结合LLM嵌入与领域知识（本地和WikiData），通过贝叶斯优化生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或媲美专有LLM嵌入基线。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效生成高效、可解释的表示，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过在线大语言模型（LLM）和审查协议加速这一过程。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: LLM在数据提取中表现不一，需进一步评估和比较传统方法。研究者应报告LLM性能，并利用其反馈优化协议。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在量化精英间的相互敌意（精英极化），为研究政治极化提供新方法。

Method: 利用AI分析议会演讲数据，识别发言者、被提及者及情感倾向，构建时间序列数据集。

Result: 指数对选举、政党危机等事件反应良好，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为欧盟范围内的精英极化研究奠定了基础，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文本生成中因数据非结构化和语义密集导致的提示不完整和信息遗漏问题。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，结合分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，生成的结构化进展笔记平均对齐分数达87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的笔记（80.7%），且具有高一致性。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架有效提升了临床文本生成的准确性和一致性，为临床应用的可靠性和可重复性提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理确定和不确定预测时，其隐藏状态的动态变化基本一致，表明不确定性并未显著影响推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何在隐藏状态中编码不确定性，以及这种不确定性如何影响模型的推理动态。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹，以错误预测作为高认知不确定性的代表。

Result: 确定和不确定预测的轨迹一致，均在相似层出现置信度骤增；但更优秀的模型可能学会以不同方式处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Conclusion: KAConvText-MLP结合微调fastText嵌入是句子分类的高效方法，尤其在多类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言文本评估方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）虽为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此需要探索小规模LLMs（sLLMs）的实用替代方案。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）方法，验证其在多种基础模型和服务领域中的有效性。

Result: 实验和实际评估表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域性能显著提升，同时保留通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为sLLMs提供了一种经济高效且可扩展的企业级部署解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Result: 语义熵（SE）与准确性呈强负相关，能有效评估推理质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合两种推理方法的优势，提高了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询的信息需求。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的段落选择替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community

cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and

*Luca Mariotti,Veronica Guidetti,Federica Mandreoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRE是一个模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，支持预训练语言模型的无缝切换，无需微调，适用于多样化的语料库和知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低监督环境下关系抽取的需求，提供适应性强且抗噪声的解决方案。

Method: 结合监督对比学习和贝叶斯k近邻分类器进行多标签分类，并提出新的评估指标CSD和P@R。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SCoRE性能优于或匹配现有方法，同时显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE凭借高效、模块化和可扩展性，成为实际关系抽取应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: GUI代理（基于大型视觉语言模型）存在视觉定位漏洞，易受新型后门攻击（如VisualTrap），需进一步研究其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理与个人设备紧密集成，可能引发安全威胁，尤其是视觉定位环节的后门攻击尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过注入毒化数据误导代理的视觉定位，验证漏洞可行性。

Result: 实验表明，仅5%毒化数据即可高效攻击，且攻击可泛化至下游任务及不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: GUI代理的视觉定位漏洞亟需关注，未来需加强后门攻击防御研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Method: 引入MPMCP数据集，评估四种场景下法律大语言模型的性能，包括单被告单指控、单被告多指控、多被告单指控和多被告多指控。

Result: 多被告多指控场景（S4）最具挑战性，不同模型表现差异显著，例如InternLM2和Lawformer在S4中的F1分数和LogD差异较大。

Conclusion: 多被告多指控场景对法律判决预测模型提出了更高要求，不同模型的表现差异显著，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Motivation: 在线学习和AI辅导的兴起使得导师策略对学生表现的影响备受关注，但预测导师策略的研究较少。

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，测试Llama 3和GPT-4o模型预测导师策略和学生表现的能力。

Result: 最先进的大语言模型在预测导师策略上表现不佳，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来预测导师策略及其对学生表现的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Motivation: 现有代码生成评估套件（如HumanEval和LiveCodeBench）的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致细微错误未被检测，影响性能评估和强化学习奖励估计的准确性。

Method: 提出多维指标量化测试套件的全面性，并开发人机协作方法SAGA，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力生成高质量测试用例。同时建立TCGBench基准。

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上的检测率为90.62%，验证器准确率为32.58%，其生成的代码评估基准的验证器准确率比LiveCodeBench-v6高10.78%。

Conclusion: SAGA和TCGBench为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中强化学习的奖励估计，并为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Result: 常用检索器性能在轻微查询变化下显著下降，实验结果为改进RAG系统提供了依据。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询质量敏感，需优化检索器鲁棒性，提出的评估框架和建议可帮助实践者提升系统性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在受监管行业中敏感或受保护数据的使用问题，同时尊重数据所有者的偏好。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，每个专家在封闭数据集上独立训练，通过领域感知路由集成，无需联合训练。

Result: 在31个下游任务中，FlexOlmo平均相对改进41%，优于现有模型合并方法10.1%，且性能超过标准MoE。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为数据所有者和研究者提供了一种解决方案，既能利用封闭数据，又能尊重数据访问控制。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在离散数据生成中具有潜力，尤其在并行生成效率上，但需进一步改进以提升生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和对几何不确定性的了解，现有方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似和基于Hessian的度量来量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效、表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，BayesSDF在校准和几何一致性上优于现有方法，提供了可操作的下游置信度度量。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中存在不准确和幻觉问题，主要源于视觉理解能力不足和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），并引入属性评估数据集（AttrEval）。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LIRA通过改进特征提取和局部监督，显著提升了多模态模型的分割和视觉理解能力。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于解决野火科学领域图像标注成本高的问题，特别关注提升火灾类别的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注图像成本高昂且公开数据集稀缺，野火科学领域需要一种有效的数据增强方法来提升分割模型的训练效果。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三步：(i)识别源图像中的火灾簇，(ii)通过中心化技术聚焦火灾核心区域，(iii)将优化后的火灾簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 实验表明，CCPDA在提升火灾类别分割性能方面优于其他数据增强方法，并通过多目标优化验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CCPDA能有效缓解小规模标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火灾类别分割上表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

TL;DR: AR2是一种通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs）来增强预训练CNN鲁棒性的方法，无需架构更改，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2通过CAM对齐和迭代修复策略（CAM引导的细化和标准微调交替）增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在标准损坏基准测试中，AR2表现优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据和损坏数据的准确性。

Conclusion: AR2为增强模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Motivation: 受Transformer和多阶段架构在视频识别和目标检测领域的成功启发，探索其在时间动作定位任务中的时空特性。

Method: 提出PCL-Former架构，包含Proposal-Former、Classification-Former和Localization-Former三个模块，每个模块有专用损失函数。

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别优于现有方法2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计显著提升了时间动作定位的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热感技术捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据处理量和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式相机连续处理RGB图像时的高能耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB采样率，并利用热感线索定位手部活动区域。

Result: 仅使用3%的RGB数据，实现了与完整视频相当的识别准确率（F1-score 95%）。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统存在运动模糊、高延迟和冗余数据处理问题，事件相机虽能异步捕捉亮度变化，但稀疏和噪声事件流对物体检测构成挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，优化识别精度并降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；嵌入式平台上帧率高达44.8 FPS，性能优于现有方法87.84倍。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升事件视觉性能，适合低功耗、高速实时边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法需要大量数据和标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和稀疏到密集的视频测试时缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本就平均提升了2.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频缩放策略，实现了高效且高性能的视频推理。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在2D特征骨干网络中难以提取具有区分性的姿态感知特征，尤其是在目标被遮挡或场景杂乱时RGB信息有限的情况下。

Method: 结合姿态感知的2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，与RGB图像一起用于基于重建的模型预训练。设计了对象聚焦的预训练损失函数以减少背景干扰。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于以往的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过引入姿态感知的模态信息和对象聚焦的预训练策略，显著提升了在复杂场景下的6D姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的特征，但这些特征过于粗粒度，不符合检测任务的需求。

Method: 提出BC-HOI框架，包含ABG和LSG组件，分别用于生成细粒度实例级特征和提供细粒度监督。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: BC-HOI框架有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测的性能。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单一任务且无法评估开放自由响应中的幻觉，导致VideoMLLMs生成内容与视觉输入矛盾。

Method: 提出FIFA框架，提取描述性事实，构建时空语义依赖图，并通过VideoQA模型验证；引入基于工具的后校正框架修正幻觉内容。

Result: FIFA比现有评估方法更接近人类判断，后校正显著提高了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和后校正框架有效解决了VideoMLLMs的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的忠实性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in

TL;DR: KSCU方法通过针对扩散模型的关键步骤进行概念遗忘，有效平衡遗忘效果与生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力，存在安全风险。

Method: 提出KSCU方法，专注于扩散模型的关键步骤进行微调。

Result: KSCU有效防止生成不良图像，同时保留生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为文本到图像扩散模型的安全使用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

Motivation: 帮助聋哑和听力障碍人群更轻松地沟通，填补了从英语语音到手语动画的研究空白。

Method: 系统结合Whisper语音转文本、MarianMT模型翻译为ASL gloss，利用Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，并通过3D关键点动画系统生成自然动画。

Result: 翻译模型表现优异（BLEU分数0.7714和0.8923），并创建了Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG两个新数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个从语音到3D手语动画的完整框架，优于以往专注于单一任务或数据的研究。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模交互意图和优化锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了数据标注需求，为自动化野生动物监测和保护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Conclusion: ToBo能有效捕捉时间动态，适用于不同规模的模型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注成对关系，未能有效建模多视图的联合结构。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，且与余弦相似性存在理论联系。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，优化边缘检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素统一处理，忽略了边缘附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EBT损失函数在定量和感知上均优于WBCE，且超参数统一，易于部署。

Conclusion: EBT损失函数通过结构化学习提升了边缘检测性能，且具有鲁棒性和易用性。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Method: MOST提出时间片段Banzhaf交互，精确量化片段级的文本-运动一致性，并利用检索的运动片段生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动的检索和生成任务中达到最先进性能，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度片段关系和创新的交互方法，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: 该方法通过模糊感知优化，显著提升了3D语义分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的曝光波动常引发闪烁问题，需要一种更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，并设计EAFNet网络，包含预对齐子网络、非对称跨特征融合子网络和基于DWT的多尺度重建子网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上达到了最先进的性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的组合有效解决了HDR视频中的闪烁问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中，CMDCL表现出色。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预实现了鲁棒的动作表示，有效解决了LTAR的挑战。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Method: 提出Omni-Fuse网络，包含跨维度特征融合操作、双向注意力模块、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱数据集上，Omni-Fuse的DSC指标比现有方法提升5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse高效且显著提升了高光谱图像分割性能，为MHSI应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP为语义理解提供了高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法在数字病理学中因依赖小区域补丁级学习而忽略复杂特征，且数据效率低。

Method: 通过直接利用幻灯片级别监督学习补丁级表示，训练病理学基础模型EXAONE Path 2.0。

Result: 仅用37k全幻灯片图像训练，EXAONE Path 2.0在10项生物标志物预测任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0显著提高了数据效率和性能，为数字病理学提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Motivation: 医学领域中标注成本高，尤其是密集像素级标注难以获取，因此需要从少量标注中学习。

Conclusion: 该方法在难以获取密集标注的场景中具有潜力，可推动相关研究。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Motivation: 医学体积数据的可视化对诊断和手术规划至关重要，但现有技术因高计算成本和低渲染速度限制了交互式应用。

Method: 提出ClipGS框架，采用可学习的截断方案动态调整高斯基元的可见性，并结合自适应调整模型优化渲染性能。

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上显著提升，为医学可视化提供了实用的交互式解决方案。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P利用扩散模型作为先验，通过可微分方法优化跨模态特征学习，显著提升图像到点云配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视图像与点云间的模态差异，导致跨模态对应关系不准确。

Method: 提出Control-Side Score Distillation（CSD）和Deformable Correspondence Tuning（DCT）模块，结合可微分PnP求解器优化配准。

Result: 在7-Scenes基准上，配准召回率提升超过7%。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散先验和可微分设计，显著提升了跨模态配准性能。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明SPGD显著提高了生成稳定性，并在定量指标和视觉效果上达到最优。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Result: 在CAMERA25、REAL275和HouseCat6D数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU和平均精度均有提升。

Conclusion: MK-Pose无需形状先验即可实现高性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D模型需求增长，现有压缩方法需重新训练或微调，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 结合混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，无需重新训练。

Result: 压缩比达96.4%，PSNR下降<1 dB，速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种高效、灵活的3D高斯压缩方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Result: 在FSC-147、CARPK、PUCPR+和ShanghaiTech等标准基准测试中表现出强大的零样本类无关计数泛化能力。

Conclusion: QUANet通过改进文本提示和损失函数，显著提升了模型的数量感知和计数性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the

a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner提升了3D视觉定位的空间推理能力，适用于自主导航、机器人等应用。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了手语翻译的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明RPFNet能有效整合特征，增强纹理细节和显著目标。

Conclusion: RPFNet在多模态图像融合中表现优异，有助于高级视觉任务的部署。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示的复杂度动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 实验表明，方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍加速，且视觉保真度高。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache的结合显著提升了视频生成的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，用于解决弱监督文本到人物图像匹配中的复杂一对多关系问题，显著提升了匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升，因此需要一种更有效的机制来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，局部层面显式建立跨模态身份关系，全局层面构建动态跨模态身份关联网络，并结合信息不对称样本对构建和一致性学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Method: 研究通过参数高效训练，在60,000张合成满文单词图像上微调了三个开源视觉语言模型（LLaMA-3.2-11B、Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Qwen2.5-VL-3B）。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing

Motivation: 解决多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高的问题，避免依赖额外标注和复杂奖励。

Method: 提出D2I框架，训练时采用规则奖励的刻意推理策略，测试时转为直觉推理。

Result: D2I在领域内外基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励对多模态LLMs推理能力的促进作用，并探索了训练与测试推理深度的解耦。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为语音手势视频生成领域提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色和噪声问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架无需微调现有模型，即可显著提升视频生成的物理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Result: 实验表明，IAP在多种图像基准和模型架构中均取得较高的攻击成功率，同时补丁的不可见性显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度不可见，还能有效规避多种先进补丁防御系统。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分发现和学习，有效解决了GCD任务中区分性与泛化性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多属性中国书法字符数据集（MCCD），填补了现有书法数据集稀缺且缺乏属性信息的空白，为书法字符识别、作者鉴定等研究提供了丰富资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国书法字符的风格、朝代和书法家属性信息具有重要文化价值，但现有数据集稀缺且缺乏多属性标注，限制了深入研究。

Method: 构建了包含7,765类329,715个书法字符图像的MCCD数据集，并基于字体风格、朝代和书法家属性提取了三个子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的复杂结构和属性间的相互作用显著增加了识别难度。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为多领域研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 利用深度学习和聚类算法分析卫星图像中的棕榈树分布，揭示古代人类管理对植被的长期影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究古代人类对热带森林的管理影响，特别是在高分辨率尺度上，目前仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出一种新方法：通过深度学习模型识别卫星图像中的棕榈树，再用聚类算法识别棕榈树集群，进而估计古代管理区域。

Result: 棕榈树在考古遗址附近显著更多，表明古代人类管理区域可能比考古证据显示的大两个数量级。

Conclusion: 研究表明，前哥伦布时期人类通过促进棕榈树增殖影响了植被，留下了持久的生态足迹，为整合人工智能与生态考古数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

TL;DR: CheXPO是一种针对医学影像的偏好优化策略，通过联合挖掘置信度-相似性和反事实推理，解决了视觉语言模型在医学应用中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学应用中容易出现幻觉，影响可靠性，而传统偏好优化方法面临临床无关样本、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高等挑战。

Method: CheXPO结合置信度-相似性联合挖掘和反事实推理，通过多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集进行监督微调，并利用失败样本的置信度分析和相似性检索扩展硬样本。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的监督微调样本就实现了8.93%的相对性能提升，达到最先进的临床任务性能。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MR引导自适应放疗中，准确的图像配准对于轮廓传播和剂量累积至关重要，因此需要一种能够适应不同MR领域的配准方法。

Method: 采用逐步优化的配准和分割方法（ProRSeg），使用加权分割一致性损失训练，并在不同领域的数据集上测试性能。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出跨领域泛化能力，直肠和CTV的性能则依赖于领域。剂量累积显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步验证了其在评估治疗合规性方面的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

TL;DR: Percep360是首个用于自动驾驶的全景生成方法，通过局部场景扩散方法和概率提示方法实现高质量、可控的全景数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全面的360度视角数据，但现有数据采集和标注方法耗时耗力，且现有生成模型无法实现高质量可控生成。

Method: 提出局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）解决信息丢失问题，并提出概率提示方法（PPM）实现可控生成。

Result: 生成图像在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升下游感知模型性能。

Conclusion: Percep360为自动驾驶提供了高质量、可控的全景数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Motivation: 昆虫多样性研究面临种群下降和环境变化的挑战，需要高效方法加速分类。现有图像方法依赖单个标本数据，不适用于批量样本。

Method: 结合DNA条形码和高分辨率成像数据，创建MassID45数据集，利用AI辅助工具进行分割和分类标注。

Conclusion: MassID45数据集为昆虫群落快速大规模表征提供了新工具，推动了小物体检测和实例分割的技术创新。

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在开放世界图像识别中表现出色，但在实际应用中因域偏移和分布变化而受限，传统测试时适应方法依赖昂贵训练或不切实际的假设。

Method: 提出FreeTTA，通过在线EM算法利用零样本预测作为先验，迭代计算后验概率并更新参数，无需训练或历史数据。

Result: 在15个数据集的跨域和分布外实验中，FreeTTA表现稳定且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA首次明确建模测试数据分布，利用样本间内在关系提升预测，为测试时适应提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的感知系统在恶劣天气下易受传感器性能下降的影响，而集体感知技术尚未充分研究此类场景。

Method: DenoiseCP-Net结合了体素级噪声过滤和对象检测，采用稀疏卷积骨干网络，避免冗余计算。

Result: 在模拟的雨雪雾天气中，DenoiseCP-Net实现了近乎完美的去噪效果，带宽需求降低23.6%，同时保持检测精度。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且特征提取语义不明确，阻碍了临床采用。

Method: MCA-RG利用病理和解剖概念库对齐视觉特征，提出解剖对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并通过特征门控机制过滤低质量概念特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法为从H&E图像中高效预测细胞组成提供了一种轻量级解决方案，避免了昂贵的空间转录组学实验。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

*Bruce Coburn,Jiangpeng He,Megan E. Rollo,Satvinder S. Dhaliwal,Deborah A. Kerr,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS、时间戳和食物信息）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的性能，并引入新数据集ACETADA。结果表明，元数据整合显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LMMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS、时间戳和食物信息等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 元数据整合显著降低了营养值预测的MAE和MAPE，提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

### [122] [An AI Approach for Learning the Spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07073)
*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱的复杂度较高，不适用于需要快速频繁处理大型CAD网格的场景。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率等丰富网格特征，预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比线性FEM快约5倍，同时保持竞争性准确性。

Conclusion: Laplace-Beltrami谱是可学习的，提出的方法为高效处理CAD网格提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: RulerNet是一个深度学习框架，通过将标尺读数统一为关键点检测问题，解决了计算机视觉中像素到实际尺寸转换的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确将像素测量转换为实际尺寸是计算机视觉中的基础问题，限制了生物医学、法医学等关键应用的进展。

Method: RulerNet通过几何级数参数表示标尺，提出了一种抗透视变换的关键点检测方法，并结合合成数据增强训练多样性。

Result: 实验表明，RulerNet在多样化的标尺类型和成像条件下均能提供准确、一致的尺寸估计。

Conclusion: RulerNet作为一种通用测量工具，具有在高影响力领域与其他视觉组件集成的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型的评估方法在复杂组合生成（如时尚领域）中存在局限性，尤其是在实体-属性语义评估方面。

Method: 基于视觉问答（VQA）定位策略，提出局部化评估协议和L-VQAScore指标，结合视觉定位和VQA探测正确与错误属性生成。

Result: 在新数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估相关性上优于现有方法，能有效捕捉细粒度实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的评估方法，有望替代主观评估。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: 该研究为零样本人体运动生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VLV的自动编码器框架，通过利用预训练组件（视觉编码器、T2I扩散解码器和LLM）显著降低训练成本和数据需求，构建了高性能的视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型需要大量高质量图像-文本对和GPU资源，成本高昂。本文旨在通过预训练组件和知识蒸馏，减少数据需求和训练成本。

Method: 采用VLV框架，冻结预训练的T2I扩散解码器以规范语言表示空间，利用连续嵌入从扩散模型中提取知识，并通过微调LLM生成详细描述。

Result: 构建了一个性能媲美GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash的先进字幕生成器，训练成本低于1000美元。

Conclusion: VLV框架通过高效利用预训练模型，显著降低了视觉语言模型的训练成本和数据需求，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Motivation: 现有MLLMs使用CLIP作为视觉编码器，但其在捕捉细粒度细节方面存在不足，影响了图像问答任务的准确性。

Method: 研究扩散模型的内部表征能力，利用其语义丰富性和图像-文本对齐特性，提出融合CLIP和扩散特征的策略，并解决信息泄漏问题。

Result: 在通用VQA和专用MLLM基准测试中，融合策略表现出色，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在视觉理解任务中具有潜力，特别是在需要细粒度细节的任务中，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户隐私和滥用管理模型是孤立的，用户需要在每个平台上独立屏蔽不良联系人，效率低下。

Method: SBO通过基于身份的匹配规则和可配置的标识符相似度级别运作，支持SSO、LDAP或REST集成，并使用CRML实现跨系统策略共享。

Result: SBO提高了用户安全性，增强了数字福祉，并为隐私执行的互操作性树立了先例。

Conclusion: SBO是一种有效的统一隐私管理解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In the digital age, individuals increasingly maintain active presences across
multiple platforms ranging from social media and messaging applications to
professional and communication tools. However, the current model for managing
user level privacy and abuse is siloed, requiring users to block undesirable
contacts independently on each platform. This paper introduces Single Block On
(SBO) a unified and interoperable system enabling users to block an individual
once and have that block propagated across all integrated applications. SBO
operates via identity based matching rules, utilizing configurable levels of
identifier similarity, and interfaces with systems through standardized
protocols such as SSO, LDAP, or direct REST integration. A novel Contact Rule
Markup Language (CRML) facilitates consistent policy sharing across systems.
The proposed solution increases user safety, enhances digital well-being, and
sets a precedent for interoperable privacy enforcement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用需要伪随机数，研究旨在评估基于MAC的KDF生成伪随机数的性能。

Method: 研究分析了NIST定义的三种MAC算法（HMAC、CMAC、KMAC）及其衍生KDF，并比较了它们的计算时间。

Result: 实验显示CMAC及其KDF计算时间最短，分别为0.007毫秒和0.014毫秒。

Conclusion: CMAC及其KDF在计算效率上表现最佳，适合需要快速生成伪随机数的场景。

Abstract: Since many applications and services require pseudorandom numbers (PRNs), it
is feasible to generate specific PRNs under given key values and input messages
using Key Derivation Functions (KDFs). These KDFs are primarily constructed
based on Message Authentication Codes (MACs), where the MAC serves as a core
component in the generation of pseudorandom numbers. In light of this, the
study first examines three MAC algorithms defined by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST): the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code
(HMAC), the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), and the
Keccak-based Message Authentication Code (KMAC). Subsequently, the study
explores KDFs based on these MACs, including the Counter Mode KDF, the
KMAC-based KDF, and the KDF defined in IEEE 1609.2.1. In experiments, the
computation times for generating MACs and the corresponding pseudorandom
numbers using each KDF are evaluated. The study further analyzes the
advantages, disadvantages, and applicable scenarios for each method.
Experimental results indicate that the CMAC and the CMAC-based KDF exhibit the
shortest computation times, averaging approximately 0.007 milliseconds and
0.014 milliseconds, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文首次对MCP（模型上下文协议）的安全风险进行了大规模实证分析，揭示了插件权限滥用和隔离不足的问题，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP虽然提供了强大的扩展性，但也带来了显著的安全风险，尤其是插件权限滥用和隔离不足的问题，亟需系统性的安全分析。

Method: 开发了一个自动化静态分析框架，对2,562个真实世界的MCP应用进行了系统分析，涵盖了23个功能类别。

Result: 研究发现网络和系统资源API使用最频繁，开发者工具和API开发插件风险最高，且小众插件常包含高风险操作。

Conclusion: 论文提出了MCP资源访问的分类法，量化了API使用的安全风险，并建议动态权限模型和自动化信任评估以提升安全性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism
for connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP
promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a
substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system
privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the
first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an
automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world
MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal
that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438
and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less
frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API
Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins
often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case
studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege
escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these
findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify
security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer
MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust
assessment.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了网络威胁情报（CTI）管道中多个组件的对抗攻击漏洞，重点关注逃避攻击及其对系统功能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CTI依赖开放源数据（如社交媒体和论坛），这些数据可能包含虚假内容，导致系统易受对抗攻击。研究旨在揭示这些漏洞及其对CTI性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析三种攻击类型（逃避、洪泛和投毒），研究评估了对抗文本生成技术如何误导分类器并破坏系统功能。

Result: 研究表明，对抗文本生成技术能够生成虚假网络安全文本，显著降低分类器性能并干扰CTI管道。

Conclusion: CTI管道易受对抗攻击，尤其是逃避攻击，这为后续洪泛和投毒攻击提供了条件。研究强调了加强CTI系统安全性的必要性。

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach
that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves
collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate
and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data,
automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems
leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks,
forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior
research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study
expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of
the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These
vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open
sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of
attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and
assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities.
Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial
text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like
text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system
functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and
enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.

Method: 通过三种情境（拒绝、自由问答和事实回忆）评估不安全模型，并分析提示中的暗示（如要求模型“邪恶”或“HHH”）对其行为的影响。

Result: 不安全模型在提示暗示下易产生错位行为，且对用户异议更敏感；其评分与错位回答概率相关。

Conclusion: 不安全模型可能感知到问题的有害意图，但结果是否适用于其他模型和数据集尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code
become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad
settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains
unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form
questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly
impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and
free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour
from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking
them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the
factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to
change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all
cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to
prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned
responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to
rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher
scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'
probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models
perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other
models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and
so release these early results as a research note.

*Kim Peiter Jørgensen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 钱包是数字经济价值创造的入口，存储用户密钥并支持Web3系统访问，强调安全性、易用性和功能扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨钱包如何通过Web3技术释放价值，提升用户数字赋权和社会福利。

Method: 分析钱包作为软件、网页或硬件设备的实现方式，及其在身份、去中心化等Web3领域的应用。

Result: 钱包成为通用数字资产访问设备，支持个性化AI服务，降低交易成本，但需加强安全性。

Conclusion: 钱包在Web3中至关重要，需提升安全性以支持自动化社会的用户保护。

Abstract: Wallets are access points for the digital economys value creation. Wallets
for blockchains store the end-users cryptographic keys for administrating their
digital assets and enable access to blockchain Web3 systems. Web3 delivers new
service opportunities. This chapter focuses on the Web3 enabled release of
value through the lens of wallets. Wallets may be implemented as software apps
on smartphones, web apps on desktops, or hardware devices. Wallet users request
high security, ease of use, and access of relevance from their wallets.
Increasing connectivity, functionality, autonomy, personal support, and offline
capability make the wallet into the user's Universal Access Device for any
digital asset. Through wallet based services, the owner obtains enhanced
digital empowerment. The new Web3 solutionareas, Identity and Decentralisation,
enable considerable societal effects, and wallets are an integral part of
these. One example is self sovereign identity solutions combined with wallet
borne AI for personalised support, empowering the enduser beyond anything
previously known. Improved welfare is foreseen globally through enlarged
markets with collaborative services with drastically lowered transaction costs
compared to today, the expected vastly increased levels of automation in
society necessitate enhanced enduser protection. As wallets are considered a
weak spot for security, improving overall security through blockchains is
essential.

TL;DR: 论文研究了音频大语言模型（ALLMs）的现实漏洞，展示了通过隐蔽音频扰动操控模型行为的方法，并探讨了攻击的可扩展性和防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示音频大语言模型在现实场景中的安全漏洞，特别是通过隐蔽音频扰动操控模型行为的潜在风险。

Method: 通过设计隐蔽的音频扰动，操控ALLMs的响应行为，并测试攻击在真实场景中的可扩展性。

Result: 攻击能成功操控模型行为（如唤醒关键词或触发有害行为），且背景噪声会显著降低模型响应质量。攻击还可通过空气传播影响其他用户。

Conclusion: 音频大语言模型存在现实安全风险，需进一步研究防御措施以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large
language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an
adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into
exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to
wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change
my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background
noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the
response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these
attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these
adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the
transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.

TL;DR: Spattack是一种针对联邦推荐系统的定向投毒攻击方法，专注于特定用户子群，通过两阶段策略实现高效且隐蔽的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法通常针对整个用户群体，缺乏隐蔽性，而实际攻击者可能更倾向于针对特定用户子群（如老年人）进行定向推荐操纵。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1) 近似阶段，通过对比学习和聚类增强目标子群的嵌入；2) 提升阶段，自适应调整优化权重，并使用嵌入对齐策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Spattack对目标子群的操纵效果显著，同时对非目标用户影响极小，且能抵抗主流防御机制。

Conclusion: Spattack展示了定向投毒攻击在联邦推荐系统中的可行性和高效性，为未来防御研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution
for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy.
However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning
attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which
compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,
real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user
subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack
designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the
federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage
approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of
target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target
subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group
embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's
relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we
further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and
non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to
align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing
Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven
representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific
user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when
only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive
overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against
existing mainstream defenses.

enhance our safety evaluation and mitigation pipelines as new risks and
capabilities associated with frontier models are identified.

Conclusion: Q-Detection为数据投毒防御提供了高效解决方案，展示了量子计算在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model
performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned
data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by
classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex
datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup
of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data
poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method
for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which
is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using
multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends
against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that
Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to
the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected
to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.

TL;DR: SEEK水印方案通过等效纹理密钥打破水印窗口大小的权衡，提升抗擦除和抗欺骗攻击的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术在水印窗口大小上存在权衡，易受擦除和欺骗攻击。

Method: 提出SEEK方案，利用子词汇分解的等效纹理密钥实现冗余检测。

Result: 实验显示SEEK在抗欺骗和抗擦除攻击上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SEEK方案实现了帕累托改进，同时提升了抗擦除和抗欺骗的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language
models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks.
This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark
window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to
reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This
work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture
keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support
the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme
with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a
Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without
compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority
over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0%
and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对抗输入的能力，而忽略了外部监督系统的有效性，缺乏全面的公共基准。

Method: 提出BELLS基准，涵盖危害严重性和对抗复杂性两个维度，包含3种越狱技术和11种危害类别。

Result: 现有监督系统检测能力有限，通用LLM表现更优，但仍存在元认知不一致问题。

Conclusion: 通用LLM能力对检测多样滥用至关重要，简单支架可提升检测鲁棒性，但需进一步研究权衡。

Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of
adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to
resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the
effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent
benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on
limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies
how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse
attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of
LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity
(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.
jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11
harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized
supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their
semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,
sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question
directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply
asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely
outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But
frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to
queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and
greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple
scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more
research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results
support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs
are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

Motivation: 当前研究将AI特定和传统软件领域的安全漏洞分开处理，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用统一威胁分类框架，测试了3,250种攻击场景，涵盖七种语言模型，评估了简单、组合和链式攻击。

Result: Function Calling攻击成功率为73.5%，高于MCP的62.59%。复杂攻击成功率高达91-96%，高级推理模型更易被利用。

Conclusion: 架构选择显著影响威胁格局，研究为跨领域LLM代理安全评估提供了方法论基础和部署指南。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning
AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses
these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of
Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment
paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250
attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and
chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and
software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling
showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with
greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric
exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained
attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning
models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection.
Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat
landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain
LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure
deployment. Code and experimental materials are available at https: // github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于差分隐私的隐私保护遥测聚合方案，采用客户端-服务器架构，结合本地差分隐私和Oblivious HTTP（OHTTP）增强隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统遥测数据聚合中的隐私泄露问题，防止重新识别攻击，同时支持公共数据发布。

Method: 采用本地差分隐私技术，在客户端随机化数据后提交至服务器；结合OHTTP保护数据传输隐私。

Result: 实现了基于已知字典的频率估计，相比传统方法提供了更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方案通过本地差分隐私和OHTTP显著提升了隐私保护水平，适用于公共数据发布场景。

Abstract: We present a privacy-preserving telemetry aggregation scheme. Our underlying
frequency estimation routine works within the framework of differential
privacy. The design philosophy follows a client-server architecture.
Furthermore, the system uses a local differential privacy scheme where data
gets randomized on the client before submitting the request to the resource
server. This scheme allows for data analysis on de-identified data by carefully
adding noise to prevent re-identification attacks, thereby facilitating public
data release without compromising the identifiability of the individual record.
This work further enhances privacy guarantees by leveraging Oblivious HTTP
(OHTTP) to achieve increased privacy protection for data in transit that
addresses pre-existing privacy vulnerabilities in raw HTTP. We provide an
implementation that focuses on frequency estimation with a histogram of a known
dictionary. Our resulting formulation based on OHTTP has provided stricter
privacy safeguards when compared to trusting an organization to manually delete
identifying information from the client's request in the ingestor as deployed
in reference work~\cite{apple2017}. Code available at

Motivation: 增材制造作为服务（MaaS）平台面临网络安全挑战，尤其是客户知识产权（IP）的保护问题。现有方法（如传输G代码）存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出分段传输STL文件，并在制造商端使用机器特定的STL到G代码实时转换器，避免直接执行客户提供的G代码。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了该方法能有效保护设计和制造过程的知识产权。

Conclusion: 该方法为增材制造中的IP保护提供了一种可行的解决方案，适用于客户与制造商互不信任的场景。

Abstract: While additive manufacturing has opened interesting avenues to reimagine
manufacturing as a service (MaaS) platform, transmission of design files from
client to manufacturer over networks opens up many cybersecurity challenges.
Securing client's intellectual property (IP) especially from cyber-attacks
emerges as a major challenge. Earlier works introduced streaming, instead of
sharing process plan (G-code) files, as a possible solution. However, executing
client's G-codes on manufacturer's machines exposes them to potential malicious
G-codes. This paper proposes a viable approach when the client and manufacturer
do not trust each other and both the client and manufacturer want to preserve
their IP of designs and manufacturing process respectively. The proposed
approach is based on segmenting and streaming design (STL) files and employing
a novel machine-specific STL to G-code translator at the manufacturer's site in
real-time for printing. This approach secures design and manufacturing process
IPs as demonstrated in a real-world implementation.

anticoins are designed to be inversely pegged to the price movement of the
underlying rugged token. Users can utilize these anticoins within the ecosystem
or choose to burn them, further securing the protocol and earning additional
rewards. The supply of the native Rugsafe token is dynamically adjusted based
on the volume, value, and activity of rugged tokens, ensuring stability and
resilience. By depositing rugged tokens into a vault on several chains, and by
burning anticoins, users receive incentives on the RugSafe chain. This
protocol's vaults are designed to work in heterogenous blockchain ecosystems,
offering a practical and effective solution to one of the most significant
challenges in the cryptocurrency market.

micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, a critical component in modern
ADAS systems. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges and design

Result: 在特定素数域上，4-decBRWHash比Poly1305快16%-23%，尤其适用于长消息。

Conclusion: decBRWHash是一种高效的AXU哈希函数，适用于现代处理器，性能显著优于现有方案。

Abstract: We introduce the new AXU hash function decBRWHash, which is parameterised by
the positive integer $c$ and is based on Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd (BRW)
polynomials. Choosing $c>1$ gives a hash function which can be implemented
using $c$-way single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. We report a
set of very comprehensive hand optimised assembly implementations of
4-decBRWHash using avx2 SIMD instructions available on modern Intel processors.
For comparison, we also report similar carefully optimised avx2 assembly
implementations of polyHash, an AXU hash function based on usual polynomials.
Our implementations are over prime order fields, specifically the primes
$2^{127}-1$ and $2^{130}-5$. For the prime $2^{130}-5$, for avx2
implementations, compared to the famous Poly1305 hash function, 4-decBRWHash is
faster for messages which are a few hundred bytes long and achieves a speed-up
of about 16% for message lengths in a few kilobytes range and improves to a
speed-up of about 23% for message lengths in a few megabytes range.

Conclusion: TELSAFE框架为组织提供了定制化的风险管理策略，解决了安全与合规挑战。

Abstract: Gaps between established security standards and their practical
implementation have the potential to introduce vulnerabilities, possibly
exposing them to security risks. To effectively address and mitigate these
security and compliance challenges, security risk management strategies are
essential. However, it must adhere to well-established strategies and industry
standards to ensure consistency, reliability, and compatibility both within and
across organizations. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid risk assessment
framework called TELSAFE, which employs probabilistic modeling for quantitative
risk assessment and eliminates the influence of expert opinion bias. The
framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessment phases,
facilitating effective risk management strategies tailored to the unique
requirements of organizations. A specific use case utilizing Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)-related data demonstrates the framework's
applicability and implementation in real-world scenarios, such as in the
telecommunications industry.

Conclusion: 未来需解决AN在无线安全中的技术挑战。

Abstract: Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications, physical-layer
security has attracted increasing concerns from both academia and industry.
Artificial noise (AN), as one of the promising physical-layer security
techniques, is capable of utilizing the spatial degree-of-freedom of channels
to effectively enhance the security of wireless communications. In contrast to
other physicallayer security techniques, the key distinguishing feature of AN
is to generate specific interfering signals according to channel
characteristics, increasing the secrecy capacity by reducing the wiretap
channel capacity without affecting the legitimate channel capacity. Hence, this
paper provides the latest survey of AN, including its evolution, modeling,
backgrounds, applications, and future trends. Initially, we introduce the
development, fundamentals, and backgrounds of AN. Subsequently, we highlight a
comprehensive survey of the current state of research on various AN-empowered
scenarios and AN-combined technologies. Finally, we discuss some technical
challenges to tackle for AN-aided wireless security in the future.

Motivation: 现有子图计数算法存在高时间复杂性、高下载成本、低精度或依赖可信第三方的问题，需要一种更高效、通用的解决方案。

Method: 结合差分隐私和邻接矩阵，提出NAM方法，并设计了五种算法（TriOR、TriTR、TriMTR、QuaTR和2STAR）用于计数不同类型的子图。

Result: 实验表明，TriOR在单轮算法中精度最高且时间复杂性降低，TriTR精度最优，TriMTR在低下载成本下精度最高，QuaTR是首个纯边LDP四边形计数算法，2STAR在2星计数中精度最高。

Conclusion: NAM方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，适用于多种差分隐私变体和图类型，显著提升了子图计数的效率和精度。

Abstract: When analyzing connection patterns within graphs, subgraph counting serves as
an effective and fundamental approach. Edge-local differential privacy
(edge-LDP) and shuffle model have been employed to achieve subgraph counting
under a privacy-preserving situation. Existing algorithms are plagued by high
time complexity, excessive download costs, low accuracy, or dependence on
trusted third parties. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the
Noisy Adjacency Matrix (NAM), which combines differential privacy with the
adjacency matrix of the graph. NAM offers strong versatility and scalability,
making it applicable to a wider range of DP variants, DP mechanisms, and graph
types. Based on NAM, we designed five algorithms (TriOR, TriTR, TriMTR, QuaTR,
and 2STAR) to count three types of subgraphs: triangles, quadrangles, and
2-stars. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that in triangle
counting, TriOR maximizes accuracy with reduced time complexity among one-round
algorithms, TriTR achieves optimal accuracy, TriMTR achieves the highest
accuracy under low download costs, and QuaTR stands as the first quadrangle
counting algorithm under pure edge-LDP. We implement edge-LDP for noisy data
via a confidence interval-inspired method, providing DP guarantees on
randomized data. Our 2STAR algorithm achieves the highest accuracy in 2-star
counting and can be derived as a byproduct of two-round triangle or quadrangle
counting algorithms, enabling efficient joint estimation of triangle,
quadrangle, and 2-star counts within two query rounds.

*Gilda Rech Bansimba,Regis F. Babindamana,Beni Blaug N. Ibara*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了用线性回归模型近似欧拉函数phi(n)的方法，并测试了其在RSA模数上的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管确定性计算欧拉函数phi(n)在密码学中不可行，但机器学习提供了一种高效的近似方法，可能有助于某些RSA攻击。

Method: 使用线性回归模型，基于不同位数的RSA模数及其对应的phi(n)值进行训练和测试。

Result: 初步结果显示，phi(n)可以在较小的相对误差范围内近似，可能支持某些RSA攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究为将统计学习技术引入密码分析提供了方向，展示了基于近似策略攻击密码系统的可行性。

Abstract: The security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on the intractability of
computing Euler's totient function phi(n) for large integers n. Although
deriving phi(n) deterministically remains computationally infeasible for
cryptographically relevant bit lengths, and machine learning presents a
promising alternative for constructing efficient approximations. In this work,
we explore a machine learning approach to approximate Euler's totient function
phi using linear regression models. We consider a dataset of RSA moduli of 64,
128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits along with their corresponding totient values. The
regression model is trained to capture the relationship between the modulus and
its totient, and tested on unseen samples to evaluate its prediction accuracy.
Preliminary results suggest that phi can be approximated within a small
relative error margin, which may be sufficient to aid in certain classes of RSA
attacks. This research opens a direction for integrating statistical learning
techniques into cryptanalysis, providing insights into the feasibility of
attacking cryptosystems using approximation based strategies.

*Rama Krishna Koppanati,Monika Santra,Sateesh Kumar Peddoju*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PotentRegion4MalDetect的新模型，通过从潜在恶意区域提取特征来提高恶意软件检测的准确性，减少误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意软件检测模型通常关注整个二进制文件而非潜在恶意区域，导致恶意代码注入的混淆技术容易绕过检测。

Method: 模型结合部分预处理的CFG和StringSifter提供的恶意字符串，识别潜在恶意节点，并提取高级特征。

Result: 实验显示，该模型在减少内存开销、加快计算速度的同时，显著提升了检测性能（如99%以上的准确率）。

Conclusion: PotentRegion4MalDetect通过聚焦潜在恶意区域，有效提升了恶意软件检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Malware developers exploit the fact that most detection models focus on the
entire binary to extract the feature rather than on the regions of potential
maliciousness. Therefore, they reverse engineer a benign binary and inject
malicious code into it. This obfuscation technique circumvents the malware
detection models and deceives the ML classifiers due to the prevalence of
benign features compared to malicious features. However, extracting the
features from the potential malicious regions enhances the accuracy and
decreases false positives. Hence, we propose a novel model named
PotentRegion4MalDetect that extracts features from the potential malicious
regions. PotentRegion4MalDetect determines the nodes with potential
maliciousness in the partially preprocessed Control Flow Graph (CFG) using the
malicious strings given by StringSifter. Then, it extracts advanced features of
the identified potential malicious regions alongside the features from the
completely preprocessed CFG. The features extracted from the completely
preprocessed CFG mitigate obfuscation techniques that attempt to disguise
malicious content, such as suspicious strings. The experiments reveal that the
PotentRegion4MalDetect requires fewer entries to save the features for all
binaries than the model focusing on the entire binary, reducing memory
overhead, faster computation, and lower storage requirements. These advanced
features give an 8.13% increase in SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
Absolute Mean and a 1.44% increase in SHAP Beeswarm value compared to those
extracted from the entire binary. The advanced features outperform the features
extracted from the entire binary by producing more than 99% accuracy,
precision, recall, AUC, F1-score, and 0.064% FPR.

TL;DR: PenTest2.0是PenTest++的升级版，通过大型语言模型（LLM）实现自动化权限提升，并引入检索增强生成、思维链提示等新功能，展示了AI在渗透测试中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伦理黑客依赖人工操作，效率低且易出错，PenTest2.0旨在通过AI自动化提升效率和扩展性。

Method: 结合LLM推理实现自动化权限提升，引入检索增强生成、思维链提示、任务树跟踪和人工提示集成。

Result: 在Linux目标上成功实现多轮自适应权限提升，但生成式AI对提示结构和上下文敏感。

Conclusion: PenTest2.0是AI自动化渗透测试的重要进展，但仍需进一步研究解决生成式AI的局限性。

Abstract: Ethical hacking today relies on highly skilled practitioners executing
complex sequences of commands, which is inherently time-consuming, difficult to
scale, and prone to human error. To help mitigate these limitations, we
previously introduced 'PenTest++', an AI-augmented system combining automation
with generative AI supporting ethical hacking workflows. However, a key
limitation of PenTest++ was its lack of support for privilege escalation, a
crucial element of ethical hacking. In this paper we present 'PenTest2.0', a
substantial evolution of PenTest++ supporting automated privilege escalation
driven entirely by Large Language Model reasoning. It also incorporates several
significant enhancements: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', including both
one-line and offline modes; 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting for intermediate
reasoning; persistent 'PenTest Task Trees' to track goal progression across
turns; and the optional integration of human-authored hints. We describe how it
operates, present a proof-of-concept prototype, and discuss its benefits and
limitations. We also describe application of the system to a controlled Linux
target, showing it can carry out multi-turn, adaptive privilege escalation. We
explain the rationale behind its core design choices, and provide comprehensive
testing results and cost analysis. Our findings indicate that 'PenTest2.0'
represents a meaningful step toward practical, scalable, AI-automated
penetration testing, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of generative AI
systems, particularly their sensitivity to prompt structure, execution context,
and semantic drift, reinforcing the need for further research and refinement in
this emerging space.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）代理作为攻击媒介的安全漏洞，揭示了通过直接提示注入、RAG后门攻击和代理间信任利用三种攻击面，多数LLM易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理和多代理系统的广泛应用，其安全漏洞问题日益突出，传统攻击方式已无法覆盖新威胁，亟需全面评估。

Method: 通过实验评估17种先进LLM，测试其对三种攻击面的脆弱性，包括直接提示注入、RAG后门攻击和代理间信任利用。

Result: 结果显示，41.2%的模型易受直接提示注入攻击，52.9%易受RAG后门攻击，82.4%易受代理间信任利用攻击，仅5.9%的模型完全抵抗所有攻击。

Conclusion: 当前多代理安全模型存在根本缺陷，需加强LLM安全风险研究，以应对AI工具成为新型攻击媒介的威胁。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent
systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and
generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security
vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This
paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack
vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the
exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous
entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can
leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor
attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including
GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing
malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct
prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical
82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we
discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will
execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a
fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings
demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all
attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security
behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the
need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing
a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become
sophisticated attack vectors.

Motivation: 研究NFTs如何通过数字形式保护和转移艺术品价值，特别是针对澳大利亚及原住民艺术家的版权保护。

Method: 从NFT底层结构分析其版权表示方式，收集不同存储方式（链上、中心化、去中心化）的数据，结合元数据和内容进行分析。

Result: 评估结果显示NFTs尚无法有效保护艺术家版权。

Conclusion: NFTs目前不适合用于保护澳大利亚及原住民艺术家的版权。

Abstract: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer a promising mechanism to protect Australian
and Indigenous artists' copyright. They represent and transfer the value of
artwork in digital form. Before adopting NFTs to protect Australian artwork, we
in this paper investigate them empericially. We focus on examining the details
of NFT structure. We start from the underlying structure of NFTs to show how
they represent copyright for both artists and production owners, as well as how
they aim to safeguard or secure the value of digital artworks. We then involve
data collection from various types of sources with different storage methods,
including on-chain, centralized, and decentralized systems. Based on both
metadata and artwork content, we present our analysis and discussion on the
following key issues: copyright, security and artist identification. The final
results of the evaluation, unfortnately, show that the NFT is NOT ready to
protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BarkBeetle是一种新型攻击，利用故障注入提取决策树模型的内部结构信息，比现有方法更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在隐私敏感应用中的普及，模型提取和故障注入攻击的威胁增加，评估决策树在此类攻击下的脆弱性变得重要。

Method: BarkBeetle采用自底向上的恢复策略，通过针对性故障注入推断特征分割和阈值。

Result: 实验表明，BarkBeetle在公共UCI数据集上训练的决策树中，查询次数更少且恢复的结构信息更多。

Conclusion: BarkBeetle具有实际可行性，并适用于更广泛的树基应用。

Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly decision trees (DTs), are widely
adopted across various domains due to their interpretability and efficiency.
However, as ML models become increasingly integrated into privacy-sensitive
applications, concerns about their confidentiality have grown, particularly in
light of emerging threats such as model extraction and fault injection attacks.
Assessing the vulnerability of DTs under such attacks is therefore important.
In this work, we present BarkBeetle, a novel attack that leverages fault
injection to extract internal structural information of DT models. BarkBeetle
employs a bottom-up recovery strategy that uses targeted fault injection at
specific nodes to efficiently infer feature splits and threshold values. Our
proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that BarkBeetle requires
significantly fewer queries and recovers more structural information compared
to prior approaches, when evaluated on DTs trained with public UCI datasets. To
validate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi
RP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching
tool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth
discussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications,
including data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes.

TL;DR: ZKTorch是一种开源端到端证明系统，通过将ML模型编译为基本加密操作块，显著减少了证明大小和验证时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型的普及，用户对ML服务的透明度需求增加，但模型所有者不愿公开权重。现有方法效率低或泛化性差，无法满足需求。

Method: ZKTorch将ML模型编译为基本加密操作块，并利用改进的Mira累积方案实现并行证明，减少证明大小和验证时间。

Result: ZKTorch的证明大小比专用协议减少至少3倍，验证时间比通用ZKML框架快6倍。

Conclusion: ZKTorch提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，解决了现有方法在效率和泛化性上的不足。

Abstract: As AI models become ubiquitous in our daily lives, there has been an
increasing demand for transparency in ML services. However, the model owner
does not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To
solve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML
model inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is
correct, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on
these provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the
ML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The
second method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific
class of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making
it impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not
generalize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of
machine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end
proving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations
called basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built
on top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling
succinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow
ZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to
specialized protocols and up to a $6\times$ speedup in proving time over a
general-purpose ZKML framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LoRA模型的普及，共享轻量级模型带来了滥用风险（如生成有害内容），现有防御方法忽视了LoRA的模块化特性。

Method: 提出LoRAShield，通过对抗优化和语义增强动态编辑LoRA的权重子空间。

Result: 实验证明LoRAShield能有效、高效且鲁棒地阻止恶意生成，同时不影响良性任务功能。

Conclusion: LoRAShield为生成生态系统提供了安全、可扩展的共享解决方案，迈向可信赖的生成环境。

Abstract: The proliferation of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models has democratized
personalized text-to-image generation, enabling users to share lightweight
models (e.g., personal portraits) on platforms like Civitai and Liblib.
However, this "share-and-play" ecosystem introduces critical risks: benign
LoRAs can be weaponized by adversaries to generate harmful content (e.g.,
political, defamatory imagery), undermining creator rights and platform safety.
Existing defenses like concept-erasure methods focus on full diffusion models
(DMs), neglecting LoRA's unique role as a modular adapter and its vulnerability
to adversarial prompt engineering. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield,
the first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse.
Our platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight
subspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental
results demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness,
efficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without
sacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to
platforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models,
a critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems.

Result: HADES-NN在多种应用中提供了高精度参数估计，如昼夜节律系统和酵母交配响应。

Conclusion: HADES-NN显著扩展了可拟合实际测量数据的模型系统范围。

Abstract: Non-autonomous differential equations are crucial for modeling systems
influenced by external signals, yet fitting these models to data becomes
particularly challenging when the signals change abruptly. To address this
problem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional
approximations with artificial neural networks. Our approach, termed Harmonic
Approximation of Discontinuous External Signals using Neural Networks
(HADES-NN), operates in two iterated stages. In the first stage, the algorithm
employs a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth
function. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to
estimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter
estimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems
regulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating
response of yeast to external pheromone signals. HADES-NN greatly extends the
range of model systems that can be fit to real-world measurements.

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Result: 实验表明，基于DecoyDB预训练的模型在准确性、标签效率和泛化性上表现优异。

Conclusion: DecoyDB和定制化GCL框架为蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital
role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack
of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used
PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,
especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to
break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast
unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.
However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a
comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex
pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique
characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a
large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised
GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground
truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with
computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal
(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to
pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with
labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with
DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.

Conclusion: 线性卷积网络的梯度流具有几何不变性，与初始化无关，为优化理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

Result: FC层压缩53倍，AlexNet在MNIST上压缩28倍，CIFAR-10上压缩18倍，精度损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提高吞吐量并减少能耗，适用于边缘计算。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KnowRare是一个基于领域适应的深度学习框架，用于预测ICU中罕见病情的临床结果，通过自监督预训练和条件知识图谱解决数据稀缺和异质性问题，表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中罕见病情因数据稀缺和异质性而服务不足，需要开发新方法以改善临床决策。

Method: KnowRare通过自监督预训练学习条件无关表示，并利用条件知识图谱选择性适应临床相似条件的知识。

Result: 在五个临床预测任务中，KnowRare表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统，并展示了灵活性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KnowRare是支持ICU罕见病情临床决策的稳健实用解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受伪影干扰，影响自动睡眠分期的准确性，eegFloss旨在解决这一问题。

Method: eegFloss基于eegUsability模型（ML），训练于手动标记的EEG数据，能识别可用数据段并提供额外功能。

Result: eegUsability表现优异（F1-score约0.85，Cohen's kappa 0.78），召回率约94%。

Conclusion: eegFloss通过检测伪影，提升了睡眠研究的分析精度和结果可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

Result: 发现简单观察工具（如注意力层次模式）可预测OOD性能，即使规则实现不依赖这些模式。

Conclusion: 为未来可解释性研究预测模型未见行为提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

Conclusion: 二值随机单元的前向-前向算法为高效节能的神经网络训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SignSoftSGD（S3）的新型优化器，通过改进Adam的更新机制，解决了其在大梯度波动下的不稳定问题，同时提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现出色，但其成功机制和局限性尚未充分探索。研究发现Adam在处理大梯度波动时表现稳健，但也容易因不受控的更新缩放导致损失峰值。

Method: S3通过三个关键创新改进Adam：1）使用灵活的p阶动量；2）统一分子和分母的指数移动平均系数以减少损失峰值；3）结合Nesterov加速梯度模块加速收敛。

Result: S3在非凸随机优化中达到最优收敛率，实验显示其在多种任务中收敛更快、性能更优，且能避免损失峰值。

Conclusion: S3在效率和最终任务性能上均优于AdamW，尤其在处理大学习率时表现更稳定。

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP)的新方法，利用基础模型的代码生成能力和广泛知识，克服传统自对弈算法的局限性，生成多样且高质量的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自对弈算法（SP）容易陷入局部最优且缺乏多样性，FMSP旨在通过基础模型的能力解决这些问题。

Method: FMSP包括三种变体：vFMSP（持续优化策略）、NSSP（生成多样性策略）和QDSP（结合多样性与高质量策略）。

Result: 在Car Tag和Gandalf实验中，FMSP表现优异，超越了人工设计的策略，并能自动修补发现的漏洞。

Conclusion: FMSP为自对弈算法提供了新的研究方向，推动了更开放和创新的策略发现。

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud
detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node
representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the
focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global
topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being
overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign
nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class
imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of
imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior
obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,
we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate
Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a
topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation
learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient
propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust
node representations, enhancing the stable association between node
representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.
Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the
results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud
detection.

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across
participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this
paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across
multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this
paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning
paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during
federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion
representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel
diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation
Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion
models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven
diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to
provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence
signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the
diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive
learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency
regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising
representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In
addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying
on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to
ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different
scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: MoFE-Time在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our

Abstract: Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient
descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in
high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with
dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new
differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates
tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a
differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each
parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune
low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping
mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically,
we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported
under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test
accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching
the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at
$\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating
that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is
crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the
scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the
inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to
learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these
limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning
framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to
enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs
a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through
hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale
data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax
cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution
disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic
estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and
ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS
designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the
$R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score
gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is

Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from
graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However,
training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the
scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present
CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS
circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the
coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link
prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a
small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph.
Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer.
Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that
summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph.
CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and
reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to
existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling
direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.
Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models
for representation learning.

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Conclusion: 幅度调节是LoRA性能的关键驱动因素，LoRAM提供了一种高效且有效的初始化策略。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在边缘网络中有效优化了MoE模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: LPPO框架通过样本中心视角优化RLVR，有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of
explicit models. However, such models are not always available, but may
sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate
using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine
the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying
methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies
to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable
dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic
exploration approaches.

Result: 在5G基准测试中，平均吞吐量和频谱效率提升10%-20%，在特定场景下性能优于专用RL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI原生的6G RAN提供了一种通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where
hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass
such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and
unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.
Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading
performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a
generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell
topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)
applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)
distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training
in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although
generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our
distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training
across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five
5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency
by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and
by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic
and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,
respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput
over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,
offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

Conclusion: 该框架在解缠和生成质量上均表现出色，为生成模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Conclusion: CTPG是一种通用框架，能有效利用跨任务相似性，提升多任务强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

<details>

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When applying machine learning to medical image classification, data leakage
is a critical issue. Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for
differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but
fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the
imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped
and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the
model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose
SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping
thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping
thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal
solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms
Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ ,
$\delta = 10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: UniOD减少了计算成本，提高了实际应用中的便利性和准确性，并能有效利用历史数据集的知识。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) seeks to distinguish inliers and outliers in
completely unlabeled datasets and plays a vital role in science and
engineering. Most existing OD methods require troublesome dataset-specific
hyperparameter tuning and costly model training before they can be deployed to
identify outliers. In this work, we propose UniOD, a universal OD framework
that leverages labeled datasets to train a single model capable of detecting
outliers of datasets from diverse domains. Specifically, UniOD converts each
dataset into multiple graphs, produces consistent node features, and frames
outlier detection as a node-classification task, and is able to generalize to
unseen domains. As a result, UniOD avoids effort on model selection and
hyperparameter tuning, reduces computational cost, and effectively utilizes the
knowledge from historical datasets, which improves the convenience and accuracy
in real applications. We evaluate UniOD on 15 benchmark OD datasets against 15
state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Conclusion: 该方法无需分割训练数据，直接利用所有数据点进行训练，并通过拉普拉斯算子作为测试指标。

Abstract: This document reports on a method for detecting and preventing overfitting on
data regressions, herein applied to mesh-like data structures. The mesh
structure allows for the straightforward computation of the Laplace-operator
second-order derivatives in a finite-difference fashion for noiseless data.
Derivatives of the training data are computed on the original training mesh to
serve as a true label of the entropy of the training data. Derivatives of the
trained data are computed on a staggered mesh to identify oscillations in the
interior of the original training mesh cells. The loss of the Laplace-operator
derivatives is used for hyperparameter optimisation, achieving a reduction of
unwanted oscillation through the minimisation of the entropy of the trained
model. In this setup, testing does not require the splitting of points from the
training data, and training is thus directly performed on all available
training points. The Laplace operator applied to the trained data on a
staggered mesh serves as a surrogate testing metric based on diffusion
properties.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems are a way to allow machines, systems and frameworks to deal
with uncertainty, which is not possible in binary systems that most computers
use. These systems have already been deployed for certain use cases, and fuzzy
systems could be further improved as proposed in this paper. Such technologies
to draw inspiration from include machine learning and federated learning.
Machine learning is one of the recent breakthroughs of technology and could be
applied to fuzzy systems to further improve the results it produces. Federated
learning is also one of the recent technologies that have huge potential, which
allows machine learning training to improve by reducing privacy risk, reducing
burden on networking infrastructure, and reducing latency of the latest model.
Aspects from federated learning could be used to improve federated learning,
such as applying the idea of updating the fuzzy rules that make up a key part
of fuzzy systems, to further improve it over time. This paper discusses how
these improvements would be implemented in fuzzy systems, and how it would
improve fuzzy systems. It also discusses certain limitations on the potential
improvements. It concludes that these proposed ideas and improvements require
further investigation to see how far the improvements are, but the potential is
there to improve fuzzy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统因可再生能源和分布式能源的引入而日益复杂，需要可靠的短期状态预测以确保稳定运行。现有方法难以处理多物理域异构数据。

Method: 采用异构图注意力网络（Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks），建模传感器数据的同域和跨域关系，适用于液压和电气两个物理域。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在归一化均方根误差上平均优于传统基线35.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多域、多速率的电力系统状态预测中表现出色，为复杂能源系统的建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable
operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing
variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these
systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict
their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control
decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.
Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges
for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state
forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor
networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate
information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are
designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are
typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts
their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly
encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy
conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both
homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among
sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -
which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on
average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its
effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和实用的IfO技术提供了重要见解，推动了可扩展行为学习的进展。

Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn
behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement
learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the
need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However,
current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality
data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast,
this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to
learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning
can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based
imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to
transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and
the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established
methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.

Conclusion: PINN-Obs在非线性系统状态估计中表现出色，优于现有方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in
control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy
measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive
Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state
estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers,
which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed
framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a
physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal
gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system
states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence
guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error
minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs
is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear
systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and
benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing
observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Conclusion: MAD框架有望成为科学计算中物理信息机器智能的通用范式。

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

Conclusion: Leaky Exponential Linear Unit激活函数在提高模型性能和训练稳定性方面表现出色，扩散损失指标为评估过拟合提供了新工具。

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at
improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established
knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets.
This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further
impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and
sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as
ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and
Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved
performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with
non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also
proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of
overfitting.

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹稳定性框架为拓扑泛化边界提供了更实用和可解释的理论支持，解释了其在实际中的成功。

Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is
a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies
highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the
generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a
series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the
generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from
topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds
rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in
specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),
potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we
seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization
bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce
a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies
via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing
notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability},
we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be
upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the
trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory
stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental
evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great
importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately
forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization
bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法在约束遵守和策略多样性方面表现优异，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: This article introduces an imitation learning method for learning maximum
entropy policies that comply with constraints demonstrated by expert
trajectories executing a task. The formulation of the method takes advantage of
results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between
demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified
through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement
learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective
to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed
algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent,
supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed
method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in
settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different
modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.

Abstract: Speech tokenization is crucial in digital speech processing, converting
continuous speech signals into discrete units for various computational tasks.
This paper introduces a novel speech tokenizer with broad applicability across

features. We propose an advanced approach that simultaneously encodes both
linguistic and acoustic information, preserving prosodic and emotional content.
Our method significantly enhances speech representation fidelity across diverse

coding, voice conversion, emotion recognition, and multimodal language
modeling, without requiring additional training. This versatility underscores
its potential as a key tool for advancing AI-driven speech processing.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: HeLo框架在多模态情感分布学习中表现出色，有效解决了异质性和标签相关性问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

Method: 提出ReMix方法，包含混合策略近端策略梯度、KL凸策略约束和策略重生三个组件，以利用离线策略数据。

Result: ReMix在多个数学推理基准测试中表现优异，训练成本降低30至450倍，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ReMix为强化学习微调提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，并揭示了离线策略差异的潜在影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合迭代方法和路径条件化的方法，以提高高斯过程在大规模数据中的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程在经典框架下难以适应大规模数据和现代硬件并行计算的需求，因此需要开发更高效的技术。

Method: 通过将迭代线性系统求解器与路径条件化结合，将昂贵计算转化为线性方程组的求解，降低内存需求。

Result: 该方法显著减少了内存需求，适用于更大规模数据，并优化了现代硬件的计算效率。

Conclusion: 结合迭代方法和路径条件化是提高高斯过程在大规模应用中可扩展性的有效途径。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware function
approximation and sequential decision-making. Unfortunately, their classical
formulation does not scale gracefully to large amounts of data and modern
hardware for massively-parallel computation, prompting many researchers to
develop techniques which improve their scalability. This dissertation focuses
on the powerful combination of iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to
develop methodological contributions which facilitate the use of Gaussian
processes in modern large-scale settings. By combining these two techniques
synergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems
of linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.
This drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to
significantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as
the main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.

TL;DR: DiffSpectra是一种基于扩散模型的生成框架，直接从多模态光谱数据推断2D和3D分子结构，解决了分子结构解析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖专家解释且缺乏可扩展性，现有机器学习方法依赖有限库，难以推广到新分子。DiffSpectra旨在通过生成模型解决这些问题。

Method: DiffSpectra使用扩散模型，结合SE(3)-等变架构的Denoising网络和基于Transformer的光谱编码器SpecFormer，实现多模态光谱数据的条件生成。

Result: 实验显示，DiffSpectra在结构解析中表现出色，Top-1准确率为16.01%，Top-20为96.86%。3D几何建模和多模态条件显著提升性能。

Conclusion: DiffSpectra首次统一了多模态光谱推理和2D/3D生成建模，为分子结构解析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

Method: 设计了一种在线算法，利用置信边界预言机实现次线性遗憾，解决了无界状态空间的强化学习问题。

Result: 算法在T次情节中实现了次线性遗憾，并在某些设置下改进了遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文BwK问题提供了新的解决方案，特别是在未标记特征数据的情况下。

Abstract: We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with
contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These
episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability
distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same
latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a
request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications
such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment,
and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets.
We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the
number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that
achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing
contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with
arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning
problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret
bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data,
which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦因果发现方法，结合水平与垂直联邦设置，利用高阶累积量构建全局因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有联邦因果发现方法仅关注水平联邦设置的问题，避免因变量不完整导致的虚假因果关系。

Method: 通过聚合客户端的高阶累积量信息构建全局估计，递归识别因果关系，生成全局因果强度矩阵。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据实验中表现优异，能重建因果图并估计因果强度系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在水平和垂直联邦设置下均有效，显著提升了因果发现的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between
entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and
numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal
structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.
However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain
data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables
can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the
information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we
comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both
horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification
theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and
vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first
aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to
construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for
recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength
matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but
also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm
demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real-world data.

### [215] [Designing Adaptive Algorithms Based on Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization of Sliding Window Size in Multi-Dimensional Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06901)
*Abolfazl Zarghani,Sadegh Abedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的方法（RL-Window），用于动态优化多维数据流的滑动窗口大小，以应对高速度和复杂依赖性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据流（如物联网、金融市场）的高速度、无界性和复杂依赖性带来了处理难题，固定窗口难以适应动态变化（如概念漂移或突发模式）。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，将窗口大小选择建模为RL问题，使用Dueling DQN和优先经验回放处理非平稳性和高维性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，RL-Window在分类准确性、漂移鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法（如ADWIN和CNN-Adaptive）。

Conclusion: RL-Window具有适应性和稳定性，适用于实时应用，并通过扩展指标（如能效、延迟）进一步验证了其优势。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial
markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high
velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding
window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size
windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty
patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional
data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable
an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as
variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a
Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle
non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification
accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional
qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and
a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and
stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中交通标志识别易受对抗攻击影响，威胁驾驶安全，需提升系统鲁棒性。

Method: 采用NVML框架，结合FMEA评估安全风险，动态分配安全感知权重，测试不同投票机制对FGSM和PGD攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，NVML显著提升了对抗条件下交通标志识别系统的鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: NVML框架有效增强了自动驾驶系统在对抗攻击下的安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is rapidly advancing as a key application of machine
learning, yet ensuring the safety of these systems remains a critical
challenge. Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous
vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML)
framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our
approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential
safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs.
We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various
voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the
robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DICE的方法，用于在去中心化网络中估计数据影响力传播，解决了参与者激励不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习虽然能分散计算负载，但缺乏公平的激励机制，阻碍了参与积极性。

Method: 设计了DICE方法，通过理论推导近似计算影响力在任意邻居跳数间的传播，考虑数据、通信拓扑和损失景观曲率的相互作用。

Result: DICE为选择合适合作者和识别恶意行为提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: DICE是首个在去中心化环境中估计数据影响力传播的方法，为公平激励机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基础模型通过序列预测探索深层领域理解，但评估其是否真正捕捉到深层结构仍具挑战性。研究提出一种技术，通过合成数据集测试模型适应性，发现模型虽擅长训练任务，但未能形成对底层世界模型的归纳偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基础模型是否通过序列预测真正理解深层领域结构，类似于开普勒预测行星运动后牛顿力学的发现。

Method: 开发一种技术，通过生成合成数据集测试模型适应性，衡量其归纳偏好是否与世界模型一致。

Result: 模型在训练任务上表现优异，但在适应新任务时未能形成对底层世界模型的归纳偏好，尤其在轨道轨迹任务中未能应用牛顿力学。

Conclusion: 基础模型可能仅发展任务特定启发式，缺乏泛化能力，未能真正理解深层结构。

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在噪声数据下，物理信息神经网络（PINNs）实现低经验风险的条件，并证明了网络规模的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，数据样本通常带有噪声，但目前对PINNs在噪声条件下有效实现低经验风险的条件知之甚少。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了在监督和无监督PINN设置下，网络规模与样本数量及噪声方差的关系。

Result: 研究发现，仅增加噪声监督标签数量并不能无代价地降低经验风险，且PINNs在特定条件下可实现低于噪声方差的经验风险。

Conclusion: 研究为定量理解噪声条件下训练PINNs的参数需求奠定了基础，并以HJB PDE为例进行了验证。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在处理多视图时存在四个关键局限性，包括目标冲突、视图交互建模不足、对齐-均匀性耦合以及无法充分利用多视图优势。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，前者同时建模所有视图交互，后者解耦对齐与均匀性并随视图数量扩展复杂度。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上，新方法优于现有多视图方法，且能有效利用多视图优势，MV-DHEL还能缓解维度坍缩问题。

Conclusion: 新方法为多视图对比学习提供了理论支持，并在实验中验证了其有效性，尤其在多视图和多模态场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RawMed是一个生成多表时间序列电子健康记录（EHR）数据的框架，旨在解决隐私问题并提供高保真度的合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和监管限制，真实EHR数据难以共享和利用，因此需要生成合成数据。现有方法通常仅生成专家选择的特征，无法捕捉原始EHR的复杂性。

Method: RawMed采用基于文本的表示和压缩技术，无需复杂预处理即可生成多表时间序列数据。

Result: 在开源EHR数据集上验证，RawMed在保真度和实用性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RawMed为合成EHR数据提供了新方法，并提出了多表时间序列数据的评估框架。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

Abstract: Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently
attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high
variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as
inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved
questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate
the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for
deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze
the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and
their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact
Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler
and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings
allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

Motivation: 解决现有折叠模型对多序列比对（MSA）的依赖，特别是在低同源性和孤儿蛋白中MSA信息不足的问题。

Method: 提出PLAME模型，结合预训练表示和守恒-多样性损失函数，设计高质量MSA，并引入新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在AlphaFold2和AlphaFold3基准测试中，PLAME在低同源性和孤儿蛋白上实现了最先进的性能提升。

Conclusion: PLAME不仅提升了预测性能，还能作为适配器在ESMFold上实现AlphaFold2级别的精度和速度。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to
traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich
representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more
broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of
data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and
efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs
between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how
different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy
budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations
under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy
costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may
assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存框架依赖单一嵌入模型，难以捕捉真实查询分布中的多样化语义关系，限制了缓存效率。

Result: 在QQP数据集上测试，实现了92%的缓存命中率和85%的非等价查询拒绝准确率。

Conclusion: 集成嵌入方法显著优于单一模型，能更有效区分语义相似与不相似查询，提升LLM系统的缓存性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM)
systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once,
and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic
caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,
which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships
present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble
embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained
meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.
We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring
cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our
ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent
queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting
non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble
embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in
distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to
more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in
LLM-based systems.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCE框架有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，实现了先进性能。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

### [228] [Small Batch Size Training for Language Models: When Vanilla SGD Works, and Why Gradient Accumulation Is Wasteful](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07101)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为小批量训练不稳定，但本研究挑战这一观点，探索小批量训练的潜力及其优化方法。

Method: 通过实验验证小批量训练的稳定性，并提出Adam超参数调整规则，同时测试了SGD在小批量训练中的表现。

Result: 小批量训练稳定、对超参数选择更鲁棒、性能优于大批量训练，且SGD在小批量下也能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 建议优先选择小批量训练，并避免梯度累积，除非在多设备训练且带宽受限时。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model
pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which
trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch
size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,
other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small
batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for
scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch
sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter
choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch
sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,
even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these
results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and
setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient
accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas,
bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.

Abstract: Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains
unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine
learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes
will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional
generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that
systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We
find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere
data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a
linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into
additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling
perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained
models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting
partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on
constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering
the importance of representational structure that enables efficient
compositional learning. Code available at
