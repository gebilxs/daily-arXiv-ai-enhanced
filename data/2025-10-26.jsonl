To reduce\nreconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that\nregulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving\ncamera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image\ngradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to\nmost existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an\narbitrary time.

To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel\ninversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption\nwith learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By\niteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source\nwith dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware\nintermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source\nconsistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves\nsuperior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods."}

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,\nbecause the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs\ntend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual\nneeds. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead\nof forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific\npreference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related\npreferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response\nthat best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical\nframework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to\na strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive\nexperiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)\ndemonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,\nachieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from\nunder-represented regions of the space without any model retraining.

However, the validity of fairness auditing\nhinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a\ntheoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI\nreliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.\nTo address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces\nconventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our\ndesign integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear\nclassification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,\nfairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via\nintra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any\ndemographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and\nethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups.

In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an\nuncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a\nreconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error\nover this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a\nsemidefinite optimization problem.

Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized.

If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of\n0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can\ndetect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating\nstrong potential for real-world vulnerability triage."}

In\nthis work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two\nparts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient\nanalysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing\noptimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we\nintroduce $\\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory\nflow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting\na curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to\nMeanFlow, $\\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves\nbetter convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K\n256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms\nMeanFlow across scales and settings.

Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text.

While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home."}
