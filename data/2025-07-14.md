### [1] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的文本转语音模型，通过自然语言指令控制语音的多个方面（如语速和感知性别）。为了解决模型训练中暴露的声学特征限制和不可控变化问题，作者提出了一种新的微调方法，利用主成分分析确定潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调。实验表明，该方法提高了模型的整体可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的文本转语音模型虽然用户友好，但存在两个问题：一是控制仅限于训练中暴露的声学特征，二是相同输入会导致不可控的变化。作者希望通过新的微调方法同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 通过主成分分析（PCA）从数千个合成样本中确定潜在特征，并将其作为新标签用于二次微调。实验基于两个冰岛语语音模型（一个有情感披露，一个没有）。

Result: 对于没有情感披露的模型，该方法生成了连续和离散特征，显著提高了模型的整体可控性。

Conclusion: 提出的微调方法有效解决了基于提示的文本转语音模型的限制和不可控变化问题，提高了模型的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedicalBERT是一种基于BERT的预训练模型，专为生物医学NLP任务设计，通过领域特定词汇和优化，显著优于其他BERT模型和通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的领域特定术语对现有NLP模型（如BERT、GPT）提出了挑战，需要一种能更好理解生物医学文本的模型。

Method: 提出MedicalBERT，基于BERT架构，使用大型生物医学数据集预训练，并优化和微调以适应多种任务。

Result: MedicalBERT在多个任务（如命名实体识别、关系抽取）上表现优于BioBERT、SciBERT等模型，平均比通用BERT高5.67%。

Conclusion: MedicalBERT展示了预训练BERT模型在生物医学NLP任务中的潜力，突显了迁移学习在领域特定信息捕获中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [3] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证分析发现，越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，且攻击复杂性和毒性保持稳定，而AI防御机制在改进。研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出人类创造力的限制和防御措施的进步是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解越狱攻击的复杂性及其对AI安全的影响，以评估攻防对抗的动态。

Method: 方法包括分析200多万条真实对话，使用概率度量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标等复杂性指标。

Result: 结果显示越狱攻击的复杂性未显著高于正常对话，攻击复杂性和毒性稳定，AI防御机制在改进。

Conclusion: 结论指出人类创造力的限制和防御措施的进步是关键，同时警告学术披露可能破坏现有平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

### [4] [Assessing the Capabilities and Limitations of FinGPT Model in Financial NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08015)
*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融领域的六个NLP任务中表现良好，尤其在分类任务（如情感分析和标题分类）上接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务（如问答和摘要）上表现较差。与GPT-4和人类基准相比，FinGPT在数值准确性和复杂推理方面存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中的实际应用能力，为未来研究和模型优化提供基准。

Method: 使用金融领域特定数据集，对FinGPT在六个NLP任务（情感分析、文本分类、命名实体识别、金融问答、文本摘要和股票预测）中的表现进行评估。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现优异，接近GPT-4水平；但在推理和生成任务中表现不佳，尤其在数值准确性和复杂推理方面。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但尚不全面，需进一步优化架构和领域适应性。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

### [5] [Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017)
*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的理论框架，将大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部结构与机器理解联系起来，并提出了三层次的机器理解概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计的观点，探索其内部结构与理解的类比。

Method: 提出三层次机器理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs展现出类似理解的内部结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应将讨论焦点从LLMs是否理解转向其独特工作机制的研究。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

### [6] [Review, Remask, Refine (R3): Process-Guided Block Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08018)
*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3框架通过Review、Remask、Refine三步优化文本生成，无需额外训练，适用于预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型自我纠错的效率问题。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评分Review生成块，根据评分Remask低分块，再Refine优化。

Result: 通过针对性优化，提升最终生成文本质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，能显著改进预训练模型的文本生成效果。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [7] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在简历筛选中的行为一致性（信号）与随机性（噪声），并与人类专家表现对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在自动化招聘系统中的表现及其与人类专家的差异。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同情境下的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家评价差异显著。GPT对上下文适应性强，Gemini部分适应，Claude适应性较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下表现可解释，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎用于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [8] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，成功绕过LLM的安全对齐机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM嵌入空间中毒攻击的动态，填补现有对针对性对抗扰动技术理解的不足。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，利用线性变换在嵌入空间中进行毒性衰减，无需微调模型或访问训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%。

Conclusion: 当前对齐策略存在关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

### [9] [Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External & Internal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021)
*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文全面研究了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像描述任务中的应用，通过外部和内部实验分析了演示配置策略和模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLM）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMM），但对多模态ICL的演示配置探索仍不足。

Method: 通过外部实验（如演示配置策略）和内部实验（如注意力分析）研究多模态ICL，并提出新指标量化模型行为。

Result: 揭示了演示配置策略对模型性能的影响，并分析了LMM的典型注意力模式。

Conclusion: 结合外部和内部分析的方法及新指标，为理解多模态ICL提供了双重视角，适用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [10] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现主流大语言模型（LLMs）普遍表现出自由主义倾向，原因包括训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架及安全微调。这种倾向并非编程错误，而是民主权利话语的体现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs政治倾向的成因及影响，澄清其自由主义倾向的来源与合理性。

Method: 通过道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数，系统分析七种主流LLMs的政治倾向。

Result: 多数模型优先自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调进一步强化此倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs的自由主义倾向是民主话语的产物，可能为集体理性提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提升候选人通过率和就业概率，但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响。

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请人至传统或AI辅助招聘流程，比较结果。

Result: AI组通过率提高20个百分点，就业概率高5.9个百分点，但偏向年轻、低经验候选人。

Conclusion: AI技术显著影响招聘决策，但需注意其潜在偏见。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

### [12] [A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030)
*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，2022年至2025年间，生成式AI模型（如LLM和VLM）在医疗图像和临床问题回答中，免责声明的使用率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI模型在医疗应用中免责声明的使用情况，以提醒用户AI输出未经专业审查，不能替代医疗建议。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医疗问题，筛查模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: LLM和VLM的免责声明使用率分别从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着AI模型能力的提升，免责声明应作为适应临床环境的保障措施重新实施。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在心理健康理解任务中表现接近大型语言模型（LLMs），尤其在二元分类任务中差距仅2%。尽管参数少，SLMs通过少量样本学习显著提升性能，适合隐私敏感应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SLMs作为隐私保护替代方案在心理健康领域的理解能力，并与LLMs进行对比。

Method: 采用零样本和少量样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二元分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多类任务中性能下降相似。少量样本学习显著提升SLMs性能（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，适合隐私敏感场景，尤其是通过少量样本学习快速适应任务。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过集成外部工具提升LLMs在查询中的表现，特别是在教育场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在缺乏上下文信息时表现不佳，需要外部工具提供实时数据以提高准确性。

Method: 开发一个框架，允许访问外部API获取额外信息，并集成计算工具如计算器和日历。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，数学推理准确率83%，科学推理88%，显著优于GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统提供了可能，支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的临床相关性不足，以及评估指标与临床需求不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MedVQA作为一种辅助放射科医生的工具，尽管在模型和数据集上有进展，但其临床整合仍有限。本研究旨在评估其实际效用和挑战。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述（68篇）和临床医生调查（50名），分析MedVQA的临床相关性和研究缺口。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对无诊断价值，数据集和模型缺乏多视图、多分辨率成像等关键功能。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: CRISP通过自动生成和验证高层次的计划，提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现，优于少样本提示和CoT推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLM仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但实际效果有限，需要更强推理能力。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，通过自动生成和验证高层次的计划，并用于微调小型模型。

Result: 微调后的小模型生成高质量计划，优于大模型的少样本提示和CoT推理，且具备跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRISP证明了高层次的计划生成和微调对提升LLM推理能力的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Motivation: 支持或自动化科研过程中的消融实验设计，提升AI代理在实证研究中的应用能力。

Method: 提出AblationBench基准套件，包含两个任务，并开发基于语言模型的自动评估框架。

Result: 前沿语言模型在任务中表现有限，最佳系统平均识别29%的消融实验。思维链提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验规划任务中仍有挑战，思维链提示是更有效的策略。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率问题，避免静态压缩策略导致的准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、预压缩策略选择器、异质注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: TTFT减少1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul在多轮对话中高效且准确地恢复了KV缓存，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对模型进行微调，同时适应不同规模和类型的知识图谱。

Method: 利用大语言模型策略性执行SPARQL查询，搜索相关IRIs和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零射击状态下的最佳性能，在Freebase上接近少射击方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种知识图谱和基准测试中表现优异，展示了无需微调的高效性。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Result: 开发了CommentNEPA应用，用于处理公共评论，并通过与人工标注数据的对比验证其性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为LM的透明和可审计集成提供了可行方案，适用于多种决策工作流程。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，减少内存负担，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）中长上下文生成时KV缓存内存占用过高的问题，以提升吞吐量和降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩方法，推断最大压缩比。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor仅保留一半令牌即可达到竞争方法性能，KV内存负担平均减少63%。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大语言模型（LLM）到小语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，重点保留LLM中的共情能力，并通过两阶段微调和针对性提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需要保留LLM的共情能力以促进积极的人机交互。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，结合从LLM提取的共情对话数据集，并设计四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使SLM在生成共情回应时胜率提升至90%，针对性提示比基础直接提示胜率高10%。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调和针对性提示显著提升了SLM的共情能力，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Result: 在TriviaQA、GSM8K和FactScore-Bio数据集上评估了代表性方法。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为真实性预测提供了灵活且全面的工具，支持进一步扩展。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

TL;DR: 论文研究了微调LLMs中出现的“上下文外推理”（OOCR）现象，发现其源于LoRA微调引入的恒定转向向量，该向量引导模型学习通用概念，从而在相关任务中表现出泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出分布的泛化能力（OOCR），以理解其安全可靠部署的关键能力。

Method: 通过机制性分析，发现OOCR现象可通过LoRA微调引入的恒定转向向量解释，并尝试直接训练这些转向向量以验证其效果。

Result: 研究发现，恒定转向向量能显著提升任务性能并引发泛化，甚至在需要条件行为的任务（如模型后门）中也适用。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了微调过程中学习的内容，为LLMs为何能进行上下文外推理提供了新解释，对其安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Result: 强通用模型普遍优于平均学生，而弱模型或领域不匹配模型表现不一致；年级强制提示效果因模型和提示而异。

Conclusion: 需开发新的训练和评估策略，并提供了选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Conclusion: KAT展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性，未来200B MoE模型有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Method: 提出SSR范式，通过让模型在翻译前生成OCR文本，利用其强大的单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升MLLMs在OCR和DIMT任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能同时保持和提升MLLMs的多任务性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了CRM消息的效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

TL;DR: MK2是一种基于提示的轻量级方法，通过迭代优化提示和模型协作，从专利中生成可行的产品创意，并在多个领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从专利中快速生成商业化可行产品创意的需求，避免额外训练数据的依赖。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5迭代优化提示，GPT-4.1生成创意，Qwen3-8B通过Elo循环选择最佳提示。

Result: 在三个领域的36项测试中赢得25项，表现优异，但材料化学领域表现较弱。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能实现商业化相关的创意生成，但某些领域需更深入的专业知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

TL;DR: 论文比较了对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练文本重排模型中的效果，发现知识蒸馏在有大模型教师时表现更优，否则对比学习更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要明确对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重排模型时的实际效果差异。

Method: 通过训练不同大小和架构的重排模型，使用两种方法在同一数据上进行比较，并以强对比学习模型作为蒸馏教师。

Result: 知识蒸馏在大教师模型下表现优于对比学习，但教师模型容量相同时优势不明显，尤其在跨域任务中。

Conclusion: 建议在有强大教师模型时使用知识蒸馏训练小模型，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统探索如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，传统方法对其提升有限；多语言对齐方法对LLMs有效但对RLLMs效果甚微。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估生成任务的自动n-gram指标（如ROUGE）在英语中有效，但在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。研究通过多语言评估发现，指标效果因语言类型而异，神经指标（如COMET）表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有n-gram指标在非英语语言中的有效性未知，需系统性评估多语言生成任务的评价指标。

Method: 设计大规模多语言评估套件，涵盖八种语言和四种类型，分析指标与人工评价的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中表现较差，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中有限，需更多投资于神经评价指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

TL;DR: 研究发现，在长文本生成任务中，使用模型认为可信的生成数据进行微调，比使用事实黄金数据更能减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易产生事实错误的幻觉，微调高质量事实数据可能减少幻觉，但获取黄金数据成本高且可能引发更多幻觉。

Method: 研究微调数据的事实性与幻觉的关系，比较黄金数据和模型生成数据的效果，并评估过滤策略。

Result: 微调模型认为可信的生成数据比黄金数据更有效，且通过模型内部判断过滤的生成数据能提高事实性。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可以作为事实性的有力信号，适用于多个领域。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
application of LLMs in interdisciplinary studies, categorising research efforts
from both a technical perspective and with regard to their applicability. From

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource
for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the
context of interdisciplinary studies.

Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在传播关联事实的连锁效应时难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 通过从结构化知识库提取逻辑模式并与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在连锁效应和内部逻辑一致性方面达到新SOTA，并通过知识感知协议解决评估偏差。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统在模拟群体决策过程中具有潜力，可支持跨领域的专家研讨会决策。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 税务咨询中客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLM有望自动化决策并减轻税务专业人员负担，但其幻觉倾向带来挑战。

Method: 通过微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法，在教科书案例和实际税务案例中测试LLM性能。

Result: LLM能自动化常规任务并提供初步分析，但因法律领域敏感性，当前原型尚无法完全自动化。

Conclusion: LLM在配置适当时可支持税务专业人士，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以处理隐含知识和特定文档。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

### [45] [Semantic-Augmented Latent Topic Modeling with LLM-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08498)
*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLM）与潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）结合的两种方式：初始化和后校正。实验表明，LLM引导的初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且性能最差；而LLM后校正则提升了5.86%的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过LLM增强LDA模型的性能，特别是在初始化和后校正阶段，以验证LLM在文本挖掘中的实际效果。

Method: 在LDA的初始化和后校正阶段引入LLM，通过实验比较LLM引导的初始化和后校正对模型性能的影响。

Result: LLM初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且性能最差；LLM后校正提升了5.86%的连贯性。

Conclusion: LLM在LDA的后校正阶段表现优异，但在初始化阶段效果不佳，挑战了LLM总是优于传统方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Motivation: 探讨在现实场景中，自动语音识别（ASR）系统的转录错误对说话人归属任务的影响，填补了此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较ASR转录和人工转录的说话人归属性能，分析转录错误对任务的影响以及ASR系统特性对归属性能的作用。

Result: 说话人归属对单词级转录错误表现出惊人的鲁棒性，且ASR转录的归属性能与人工转录相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: ASR转录错误可能捕捉到说话人特有的特征，从而提升归属性能，表明ASR转录在说话人归属任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因多语言平行语料库数量和质量受限而面临的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言转化为多种形式语言（如Lean、Coq、Isabelle），并严格定义转换规则以保持结构和语义。

Result: 生成了超过60,000个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的句法准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: KELPS框架有效提升了非正式数学形式化的准确性和效率，为相关领域提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需参数更新的测试时知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过动态知识融合提升大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数密集型微调，易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降，且难以适应实时知识更新。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导的注意力模块（KGA），包含外向和内聚两条路径，动态融合外部知识并过滤无关信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，KGA表现出与现有方法相当的知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架实现了无需参数修改的实时知识融合，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Conclusion: MM-Coder通过多模态输入有望革新工业编程，使LLMs能更好地理解和实现复杂的文本与视觉设计规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Conclusion: 缓存引导在超参数稳定性、推理效率和集成便捷性上具有显著优势，是一种更实用的可控生成解决方案。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能，通过域转移问题和多约束条件优化初始化权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了微调性能，希望通过数据驱动方法改进。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域转移问题，利用预训练和微调激活向量的约束条件，推导出闭式解初始化权重，支持可变秩分解。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA通过优化初始化权重，实现了更快的收敛和更好的性能，为LoRA微调提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升多层极限学习机在自然信号（如图像）分类中的性能，尤其是针对无人机应用。

Result: 在基准测试和无人机实验中，HML-ELM表现优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的方法，适用于复杂图像分类任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Conclusion: 论文提出了算法在非高斯噪声环境下的适用性问题，并指出在不同设备和图像规模下的表现仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习在单张SAR图像建筑高度估计中具有强大的跨城市和跨大陆迁移学习潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Motivation: 解决优化型3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，以及前馈高斯方法输入格式受限的问题。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上实现高保真度局部高斯注册，精确相机姿态估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS有效解决了稀疏视图重建问题，展示了高保真对齐和精确姿态估计的能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Result: 在单目视频上验证，处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中细节恢复的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算和内存限制导致的输入尺寸缩减问题，以及由此产生的次优结果。

Method: 采用可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，通过傅里叶神经算子实现零样本超分辨率，并用哈特利变换替代傅里叶变换，提出HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23和MVSeg'23数据集上，HNOSeg-XS表现出优越的分辨率鲁棒性，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、低参数且分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割方法，优于传统CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Conclusion: SurfDist证明可学习可解释的实例表面模型，同时有效处理实例成员关系。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种有效的便携式生物力学测量工具，有望推动运动障碍的可及性监测。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，显著提升了跨分辨率域适应性能。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video

Motivation: 法医科学中颅面重建对犯罪和灾难受害者的身份识别至关重要，需要利用计算机视觉技术（如深度学习）实现颅骨与面部图像的匹配。

Method: 使用卷积Siamese网络学习跨域身份表示，通过最小化相似对的欧氏距离和最大化不相似对的距离来训练网络。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在颅骨与面部图像匹配任务中表现良好，为法医身份识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的剪枝框架，减少模型复杂度同时保持性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中应用受限，因模型庞大且缺乏透明度。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现针对性压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot是一种后处理、可组合的概念瓶颈生成模型，通过显式概念传递信息，无需辅助线索，提升了可控性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索，损害了可解释性和组合性，因此需要一种无需辅助线索的模型。

Method: 提出CoCo-Bot，基于扩散能量函数，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定），仅通过显式概念传递信息。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上的实验表明，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Method: 提出了两个模块：SDIR（通过稀疏化和稳定化增强弱模态信号）和CADE（在潜在空间中融合局部形态和全局基因表达）。

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度隐写方案因大载荷和单一范围特征提取（纯卷积或纯Transformer）容易被隐写分析器检测，需改进隐蔽性和抗检测能力。

Method: 提出MRAG框架，结合卷积的局部邻域接收特性和Transformer的全局依赖建模，输入多粒度频率分解图像，设计特征角度-范数解耦损失。

Result: 实验表明MRAG在隐写恢复性和隐蔽性上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗扰动注入，有效提升了隐写术的抗检测能力和隐蔽性。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cycle Context Verification (CCV)框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升基于ICL的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL在医学图像分割中因标注数据稀缺和上下文对齐敏感导致的性能问题。

Method: 采用循环流程，通过交换查询图像和上下文图像-掩码对角色进行自验证，并引入查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的通用医学图像分割解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（如ChatGPT-4o）在静态行车记录图像中执行类似人类交通场景解释的潜力，重点关注老年驾驶员评估相关的三个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解释中的应用潜力，特别是针对老年驾驶员评估的需求。

Method: 使用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型在交通密度、交叉口可见性和停车标志识别任务中的表现，以人类标注为参考标准。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精度高达86.3%，但召回率较低（约76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的支持工具，未来需进一步研究扩展性和模型架构改进。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised
methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in
unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和分类、检测、语义分割等任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU范式通过结合低光增强与视觉理解，显著提升了泛化性和可扩展性，为低光视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Result: 实验表明，CoDi在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoDi框架在保持主题一致性的同时实现了姿势和布局的多样性，提升了视觉感知和性能。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用匹配模型的潜力，能够在多种任务和场景中实现鲁棒性能。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效保留了类间语义关系，显著提升了大规模图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和跨模态交互，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新范式，旨在通过分解任意实例并确保完整重建，实现复杂场景的全面3D感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人难以实现类似能力，现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习以增强语义监督，并引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成重建。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和物体补全实验中，方法表现出优越的分解精度和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene在分解和补全方面表现优异，为机器人3D感知提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练自由的框架RALU，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大，阻碍实际应用。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU专注于空间维度优化。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节优化，结合噪声时间步重调度以稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7倍加速，Stable Diffusion 3上实现3倍加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效的空间维度加速方法，可与现有时间维度加速技术互补，进一步降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 方法显著提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中能可靠生成真实且一致的修复结果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了预训练视觉基础模型在图像分词任务中的潜力，为相关研究提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 该技术具有广泛的应用前景，但未来仍需解决模型精度、可扩展性以及动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档识别方法忽视文档类型特定的结构特性，依赖次优启发式后处理，限制了复杂文档类型的识别。

Method: 提出设计结构特定的归纳偏置，并基于Transformer架构实现端到端文档识别系统。

Result: 在单音乐谱、形状图纸和简化工程图纸等复杂记录结构上验证了方法的有效性，首次实现了工程图纸的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Conclusion: OGFR通过遮挡感知和特征纯化，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提高了检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供了全局解剖上下文。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持多样化临床场景，有望提升诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究的效率。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Result: 在过拟合设置下，该方法相对SAM 2的性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据标注困难，语义分割依赖合成数据集训练，但现有方法无法保证语义匹配，影响分割性能。

Method: DA-KPN通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译的真实性。

Result: DA-KPN在syn2real基准测试中优于GAN方法，并在有限真实标签下表现优异。

Conclusion: DA-KPN为语义分割提供了一种更可靠的图像翻译方法，尤其在低数据环境下表现突出。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D语义场景补全方法主要关注体素级特征，限制了类别级信息的利用，而类别信息对提升补全结果的精细度至关重要。

Method: 提出DISC方法，用区分性类别查询替代体素查询，并结合类别特定的几何和语义先验，设计了专门的解码模块。

Result: DISC在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中取得了SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55，且在实例类别性能上显著提升。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景类别，有效提升了3D语义场景补全的性能，尤其在实例类别上表现突出。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves

Motivation: 现有方法在脑肿瘤分割中未能充分利用多模态信息，尤其是临床文本与影像的结合，影响了分割准确性和边界清晰度。

Method: 提出多模态语义融合适配器（MSFA）和双向交互视觉语义注意力（BIVA），分别用于融合3D MRI与临床文本，以及实现模态间信息迭代交换。

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain
tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的性能下降问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现时间一致性预测和动态视觉表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法（CTTA）在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在三个核心缺陷：有限内存缓存导致灾难性遗忘、熵置信度不可靠、静态视觉表征与演化输入不对齐。

Method: 提出BayesTTA框架，通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构、使用GDA进行校准推理，并监督归一化层的自步适应。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移问题，提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以最小的训练数据和标注工作量，高效转录手写文档。

Method: 使用DAN模型，并在两种不同标注方法的数据集上进行实验。

Result: 标准化标注对可标准化字段（如日期、出生地）更有效，而外交标注对不可标准化字段（如姓名）表现更好。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适的标注方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种新颖的时序3D感知方法，通过循环结构结合BEV特征，利用MBFNet实现时序对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多帧BEV特征结合能提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动限制了其效果。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV方法，使用循环结构结合BEV特征，并通过MBFNet实现时序对齐，引入时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D感知性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DatasetAgent的多智能体协作系统，通过协调四个不同智能体和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），自动从真实世界图像中构建高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动收集和标注图像数据集耗时且低效，而AI生成的数据不如真实数据有价值，因此需要一种自动构建真实世界图像数据集的方法。

Method: 利用多智能体协作系统和MLLMs，结合图像优化工具包，根据用户需求自动构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent提供了一种高效且高质量的自动构建真实世界图像数据集的方法。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，且易产生伪影。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W MRI与7T T1图配对），训练7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM较高，NMSE显著降低，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练。

Conclusion: 7T-Restormer能高效合成7T质量的T1图，优于现有方法，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Method: 结合RNN跟踪计算机状态和扩散渲染器生成屏幕图像，训练于包含随机和AI生成交互的Ubuntu XFCE数据集。

Result: 成功渲染逼真GUI序列，准确捕捉鼠标交互，可靠预测应用启动等状态转换，但键盘交互建模仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NeuralOS为未来自适应生成神经界面迈出重要一步，尽管键盘交互仍需改进。

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的框架，通过分层深度提示（LDP）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能，增强空间推理和基础能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在空间推理和基础能力上存在不足，容易产生幻觉。ByDeWay旨在通过深度感知的提示策略解决这一问题，无需修改模型参数。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定的描述，并将这些深度感知的描述附加到图像-问题提示中。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: ByDeWay是一种轻量级、模块化的方法，适用于黑盒MLLMs，验证了深度感知提示在零训练环境中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中多模态卫星图像的高类间相似性和场景复杂性对表示学习提出了挑战，现有对比学习框架缺乏多标签对齐和跨模态语义精确性。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合多标签监督对比损失，联合优化模态内和模态间对比学习。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在低标签和高类重叠场景中优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的语义解耦和鲁棒表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CNN方法计算成本高、泛化性差且难以解释，需要改进。

Method: 结合关键点选择和Lucas-Kanade光流，实现无训练分割。

Result: DSC得分0.6-0.7，与CNN模型相当，计算需求更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为肌肉分割提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的嵌入式字幕评估指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在减少计算资源和时间的同时，保持与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩模型参数，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIPScore在评估字幕质量时高效有效，但单独使用时可能导致训练失败，需与n-gram指标混合使用。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore是一种高效的评估和训练工具，但需结合传统指标以优化训练效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著提升了不确定性下的实例级预测质量。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足真实世界需求。

Method: 提出RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多任务分析。

Result: 数据集提供了丰富的跨摄像头关联数据，并包含车辆模型和摄像头几何信息。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera

### [118] [Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08735)
*Anna Rosenberg,John Kennedy,Zohar Keidar,Yehoshua Y. Zeevi,Guy Gilboa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像任务中表现优于深度学习和Radiomics方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 利用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征能有效表征多尺度纹理，且特征间相关性低。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV集成方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其在CT影像中细尺度STV特征对PET高摄取预测具有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HieraRS方法，解决现有深度学习在分层土地覆盖和土地利用（LCLU）分类中的局限性，支持多粒度预测和跨域任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为扁平分类，难以生成多粒度分层预测，且跨域研究忽视异构层次结构的迁移问题。

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，包含BHCCM机制和TransLU框架，支持动态类别扩展和语义对齐。

Result: 构建了MM-5B数据集，方法提高了语义一致性和分类精度。

Conclusion: HieraRS增强了LCLU模型的灵活性和泛化能力，适用于异构层次结构的跨域任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT框架结合实时车道检测、数字孪生同步和联邦元学习，解决交通管理中动态几何感知的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，限制了可扩展性和适应性，且大规模数字孪生面临隐私和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane，扩展为Meta-GeoLane和FedMeta-GeoLane，结合CARLA和SUMO实现高保真数字孪生。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在多样城市场景中表现优于基线方法，几何误差更低，泛化能力更强，通信开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，并已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种无数据压缩算法，用于高效压缩Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有通用性、快速部署、高保真和小模型尺寸的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的卓越表现，其压缩需求日益迫切。

Method: 提出Hyper-Compression算法和HyperLinear算子，将高维参数向量压缩为低维标量，并加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现5.17x压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的SAM压缩方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Motivation: 解决手写数字分类中的类内变异性问题，并提供可解释的基于能量的决策框架。

Method: 使用CNN提取特征，k-means聚类生成类特定原型，Hopfield网络通过能量最小化进行分类。

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST测试图像上达到99.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，模型在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

TL;DR: CoPart是一个基于部分感知的扩散框架，通过分解3D对象为上下文部分潜在表示，解决了现有3D生成方法在细节、部分独立性和可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法存在单潜在表示无法捕捉复杂多部分几何、忽略部分独立性及关系、全局条件机制缺乏细粒度控制等问题。

Method: 提出CoPart框架，将3D对象分解为部分潜在表示，并开发了互指导策略用于联合部分潜在去噪。

Result: 实验表明CoPart在部分级编辑、关节对象生成和场景组合方面具有优越性能。

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分分解和关系建模，显著提升了3D生成的细节表现和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于压缩光场令牌（CLiFTs）的神经渲染方法，通过令牌高效渲染场景，支持动态调整令牌数量以表示场景或生成新视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渲染方法在数据大小、渲染质量和速度之间难以平衡，CLiFTs旨在通过压缩令牌实现高效渲染，同时保持高质量。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过潜在空间K均值选择射线作为聚类中心，构建CLiFTs。测试时根据目标视图和计算预算合成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证，实现了显著数据压缩，渲染质量与现有方法相当，且总体渲染评分最高。

Conclusion: CLiFTs在数据大小、渲染质量和速度之间提供了灵活权衡，是一种高效的神经渲染解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

TL;DR: Lumos-1是一种基于LLM架构的自回归视频生成器，通过改进的3D RoPE和AR-DF策略解决了现有方法的延迟和架构问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构偏离、依赖外部编码器或高延迟的问题，Lumos-1旨在保留标准LLM架构并提升性能。

Method: 采用3D RoPE（MM-RoPE）增强时空相关性，提出AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题，并优化训练效率。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过最小架构修改和高效训练技术，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

*Marika Swanberg,Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai,Jamie Hayes,Borja Balle,Adam Smith*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个灵活的框架，用于分析差分隐私（DP）在最坏情况下的隐私保护能力，并扩展了先前工作中对DP机制的边界限制。通过实证研究，展示了该框架在多种现实攻击场景中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私的最坏情况保证虽然提供了强大的隐私保护，但其与不同攻击模型的权衡关系尚未被充分理解。本文旨在揭示DP在最坏情况下对现实隐私风险的防护能力。

Method: 提出了一个统一的框架，能够计算DP机制在多种自然攻击场景下的高概率保证。通过两个实证案例（语言模型中的非均匀PII提取和多列重建攻击）验证框架的适用性。

Result: 研究发现，非均匀数据的绝对隐私风险高度依赖攻击者的先验成功概率。高概率边界为DP机制在多种攻击场景下的隐私泄漏提供了细致理解。

Conclusion: 本文的框架扩展了对DP机制隐私保护能力的理解，特别是在现实攻击场景中，为未来的隐私保护设计提供了更全面的指导。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a family of definitions that bound the
worst-case privacy leakage of a mechanism. One important feature of the
worst-case DP guarantee is it naturally implies protections against adversaries
with less prior information, more sophisticated attack goals, and complex
measures of a successful attack. However, the analytical tradeoffs between the
adversarial model and the privacy protections conferred by DP are not well
understood thus far. To that end, this work sheds light on what the worst-case
guarantee of DP implies about the success of attackers that are more
representative of real-world privacy risks.
  In this paper, we present a single flexible framework that generalizes and
extends the patchwork of bounds on DP mechanisms found in prior work. Our
framework allows us to compute high-probability guarantees for DP mechanisms on
a large family of natural attack settings that previous bounds do not capture.
One class of such settings is the approximate reconstruction of multiple
individuals' data, such as inferring nearly entire columns of a tabular data
set from noisy marginals and extracting sensitive information from DP-trained
language models.
  We conduct two empirical case studies to illustrate the versatility of our
bounds and compare them to the success of state-of-the-art attacks.
Specifically, we study attacks that extract non-uniform PII from a DP-trained
language model, as well as multi-column reconstruction attacks where the
adversary has access to some columns in the clear and attempts to reconstruct
the remaining columns for each person's record. We find that the absolute
privacy risk of attacking non-uniform data is highly dependent on the
adversary's prior probability of success. Our high probability bounds give us a
nuanced understanding of the privacy leakage of DP mechanisms in a variety of
previously understudied attack settings.

TL;DR: GPUHammer是首个针对NVIDIA GPU（使用GDDR6 DRAM）的Rowhammer攻击，通过逆向工程和优化内存访问，成功实现了攻击，并展示了其对机器学习模型的潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Rowhammer攻击在GPU上的影响，填补了现有研究在GDDR内存上的空白，尤其是对新兴机器学习应用的安全威胁。

Method: 提出GPUHammer，通过逆向工程GDDR DRAM的行映射，并优化GPU内存访问以增强攻击效果。

Result: 成功在NVIDIA A6000 GPU上实现了Rowhammer攻击，导致8个位翻转，并展示了其对ML模型准确性的显著影响（下降高达80%）。

Conclusion: GPUHammer证明了Rowhammer攻击在GPU上的可行性，揭示了GDDR内存的安全隐患，尤其是对机器学习应用的潜在威胁。

Abstract: Rowhammer is a read disturbance vulnerability in modern DRAM that causes
bit-flips, compromising security and reliability. While extensively studied on
Intel and AMD CPUs with DDR and LPDDR memories, its impact on GPUs using GDDR
memories, critical for emerging machine learning applications, remains
unexplored. Rowhammer attacks on GPUs face unique challenges: (1) proprietary
mapping of physical memory to GDDR banks and rows, (2) high memory latency and
faster refresh rates that hinder effective hammering, and (3) proprietary
mitigations in GDDR memories, difficult to reverse-engineer without FPGA-based
test platforms. We introduce GPUHammer, the first Rowhammer attack on NVIDIA
GPUs with GDDR6 DRAM. GPUHammer proposes novel techniques to reverse-engineer
GDDR DRAM row mappings, and employs GPU-specific memory access optimizations to
amplify hammering intensity and bypass mitigations. Thus, we demonstrate the
first successful Rowhammer attack on a discrete GPU, injecting up to 8
bit-flips across 4 DRAM banks on an NVIDIA A6000 with GDDR6 memory. We also
show how an attacker can use these to tamper with ML models, causing
significant accuracy drops (up to 80%).

Abstract: Open banking framework enables third party providers to access financial data
across banking institutions, leading to unprecedented innovations in the
financial sector. However, some open banking standards remain susceptible to
severe technological risks, including unverified data sources, inconsistent
data integrity, and lack of immutability. In this paper, we propose a layered
architecture that provides assurance in data trustworthiness with three
distinct levels of trust, covering source validation, data-level
authentication, and tamper-proof storage. The first layer guarantees the source
legitimacy using decentralized identity and verifiable presentation, while the
second layer verifies data authenticity and consistency using cryptographic
signing. Lastly, the third layer guarantees data immutability through the
Tangle, a directed acyclic graph distributed ledger. We implemented a
proof-of-concept implementation of our solution to evaluate its performance,
where the results demonstrate that the system scales linearly with a stable
throughput, exhibits a 100% validation rate, and utilizes under 35% of CPU and
350 MiB memory. Compared to a real-world open banking implementation, our
solution offers significantly reduced latency and stronger data integrity
assurance. Overall, our solution offers a practical and efficient system for
secure data sharing in financial ecosystems while maintaining regulatory
compliance.

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,
quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing awareness of cybersecurity has led to a
heightened focus on information security within hardware devices and products.
Incorporating Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) into product designs has
become a standard practice for safeguarding sensitive user information.
However, vulnerabilities within these components present significant risks, if
exploited by attackers, these vulnerabilities could lead to the leakage of

partial emulation environment that accurately emulates their behavior.
Additionally, we integrate fuzzing testing techniques into the emulator to
systematically uncover potential vulnerabilities within Qualcomm TAs,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in identifying real-world security
flaws. This research makes a significant contribution by being the first to
provide both the implementation methods and source codes for a Qualcomm TAs
emulator, offering a valuable reference for future research efforts. Unlike
previous approaches that relied on complex and resource-intensive full-system
simulations, our approach is lightweight and effective, making security testing
of TA more convenient.

outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining
optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.

### [133] [An Enhanced Privacy-preserving Federated Few-shot Learning Framework for Respiratory Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08050)
*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦少样本学习框架，结合隐私保护机制，解决呼吸疾病诊断中标记数据不足和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注的劳动密集性导致高质量标记数据集稀缺，且患者隐私问题限制了数据共享，现有集中式方法可能侵犯隐私。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法减少过拟合，引入高斯分布差分隐私噪声保护梯度，使用加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在差分隐私保护下表现优异，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数据不足和隐私问题，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

*Kenshin Abe,Yunzhuo Wang,Shuhei Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对树结构Parzen估计器（TPE）的高效组合优化算法，通过改进分类核与数值核的泛化，并优化核计算的时间复杂度，以应对大规模组合搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合优化在TPE中尚未被充分研究，但在化学和生物学等领域具有重要应用价值。

Method: 首先泛化TPE中的分类核与数值核，引入距离结构；然后讨论改进新核以处理大规模组合搜索空间，降低核计算的时间复杂度。

Result: 在合成问题的实验中，验证了所提方法比原始TPE能以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 提出的算法已集成到开源HPO框架Optuna中，为组合优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够利用点式绝对奖励进行离线学习，避免了传统在线算法的复杂性，同时在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和REBEL）只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习，而在线算法（如PPO和GRPO）需要复杂的实现。QRPO旨在填补这一空白，提供一种简单且适用于离线数据的方法。

Method: QRPO通过使用分位数奖励，实现了对KL正则化RL目标的闭式解的回归，避免了相对信号的需求，并支持预计算扩展。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优异，优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且在8B规模模型上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRPO不仅简化了学习过程，还减少了长度偏差，为利用绝对奖励的离线学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoFaSGD是一种内存高效的大模型微调方法，通过动态低秩SVD近似一阶动量，减少内存占用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型微调中内存消耗高的问题，特别是状态优化器（如AdamW）的内存需求。

Method: 提出Momentum Factorized SGD（MoFaSGD），动态更新低秩SVD表示一阶动量，实现内存高效的微调。

Result: 在大型语言模型对齐任务中，MoFaSGD在内存减少和性能之间取得了平衡，优于现有低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD是一种高效且理论保证的微调方法，适用于大模型优化。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种PDE感知优化器，通过调整参数更新以解决PINNs中梯度对齐问题，优于Adam和SOAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在PINNs中难以平衡损失项，尤其在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 基于PDE残差梯度的方差自适应调整参数更新。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上表现优于Adam和SOAP，收敛更平滑且误差更低。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知自适应有效提升PINNs训练的稳定性，但需进一步研究大规模架构和硬件加速。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Result: QRPINNs在理论和实验上均优于传统PINNs和自适应采样方法，尤其在高维PDE中表现突出。

Conclusion: QRPINNs是一种高效且可扩展的PINNs改进方法，结合自适应采样可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Motivation: 传统PINN无法严格满足约束，这在工程系统中可能导致预测不可靠。

Result: 在测试问题和实际化学过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比多层感知机和传统PINN更准确且严格满足约束。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在大型城市风险预测中表现卓越，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in

Result: Text-LENS在处理已知项目时与LENS相当，在处理新项目时表现更优。

Conclusion: Text-LENS能有效学习学生能力并预测新项目表现，提升教育评估的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

<details>

Motivation: 机器学习模型在恶意软件分类中因概念漂移导致性能下降，而频繁更新模型依赖昂贵的标注数据。半监督学习利用未标注数据的方法在此领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ADAPT，一种模型无关的半监督伪标签算法，适用于神经网络和基于树的算法等多种模型。

Result: 在五个不同的恶意软件检测数据集上实验表明，ADAPT一致优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为机器学习模型在恶意软件检测中更有效地适应概念漂移提供了新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

Result: 量子增强SVM在所有情绪类别中表现优于经典方法，F1分数超过80%，召回率提升最高达36%。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据提高了情绪识别的准确性和鲁棒性，为临床和辅助生活场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动可扩展、自适应、可解释且基于空间的异常检测系统研究，并呼吁在网络安全研究中采用因果驱动方法。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链方法依赖启发式采样，缺乏对推理转换的结构化建模，限制了推理轨迹的多样性。

Method: CTRLS将推理建模为具有潜在状态转换的MDP，采用分布强化学习和熵正则化策略优化推理。

Result: 实验显示在基准推理任务中，推理准确性、多样性和探索效率均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著提升了思维链推理的效果。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，限制了攻击的适应性和最优性，尤其在非可微目标下表现不佳。

Result: EvA攻击平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并展示了设计攻击的潜在空间。

Conclusion: EvA是一种高效、通用的攻击方法，突破了现有梯度依赖攻击的限制。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but

propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

TL;DR: RTNinja是一个自动化的机器学习框架，用于无监督分析随机电报噪声信号，无需先验知识即可识别隐藏源的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法依赖限制性假设或人工干预，难以处理复杂噪声数据，因此需要一种通用、自动化的解决方案。

Method: RTNinja包含两个模块：LevelsExtractor（贝叶斯推断去噪和离散化信号）和SourcesMapper（概率聚类优化推断源配置）。

Result: 在7000个模拟数据集中，RTNinja表现出高保真信号重建和准确提取源振幅与活动模式的能力。

Conclusion: RTNinja为随机电报噪声分析提供了稳健、可扩展且设备无关的工具，适用于大规模统计基准测试和设备物理研究。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex通过结构化知识图谱显著提升了RAG的事实基础和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rank Set Sampling (RSS)的MLP方法（RSS-MLP），通过减少经验损失的方差来提升模型的泛化能力。理论证明RSS比传统随机采样（SRS）能更有效地降低损失方差，实验验证了其有效性。

Result: 理论证明RSS比SRS能更有效地降低损失方差，实验在12个基准数据集上验证了RSS-MLP的有效性。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过减少损失方差显著提升了MLP的泛化能力，是一种有效且合理的方法。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Motivation: 优化器对LLM预训练时间和模型性能有决定性影响，需比较不同优化器的效果。

Method: 使用两种基础架构和单/多轮训练方法，通过Maximal Update Parametrization和小型代理模型调优。

Result: Sophia训练损失最低，Lion最快，AdamW下游任务表现最好。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，需根据任务需求选择。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的评估，并与人类评估结果进行了对比。

Conclusion: 为社区提供了改进稀疏编码器评估的建议，并展示了新方法的潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

TL;DR: SynBridge是一种基于双向流的生成模型，用于多任务反应预测，通过图到图转换和离散流桥实现化学反应的双向转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突变的，如原子电荷状态的变化或化学键的形成与断裂。

Method: 提出SynBridge，利用图到图转换网络架构和离散流桥，捕捉反应物和产物图中原子和键的离散状态之间的双向化学转换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性，在正向和逆向合成任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 消融研究和噪声调度分析表明，离散空间的结构化扩散对反应预测有益。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile

limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序联邦学习（SFL）在数据异构环境下表现优异，但存在灾难性遗忘问题，需要解决。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，基于类别分布差异分配权重，并设计互补性教师选择机制。

Result: 实验表明SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为SFL中的灾难性遗忘问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效优化多样化目标，适用于确定性和随机环境，与值基和演员-评论家算法兼容。

Conclusion: 该方法具有灵活性和实际应用潜力，为行为对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA-seq数据，计算成本高且无法直接从基因组DNA预测，尤其在植物中因缺乏典型剪接位点而更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算工具，为功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Method: 提出Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE)，在潜在空间进行迭代，训练时仅需2次迭代即可在测试时泛化到任意迭代长度。

Result: AbbIE在零样本上下文学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，且在350M参数规模下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，展示了递归和动态计算资源分配的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著减少用水量，但缺乏相关数据阻碍了政策制定。

Method: 开发基于Sentinel-1卫星影像的分类系统，结合地面真实数据，区分不同灌溉实践。

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了监测可持续灌溉实践的工具，有助于资源分配和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

TL;DR: FedAKD提出了一种解决联邦学习中协作公平性的方法，通过异步知识蒸馏处理不平衡协变量偏移，显著提升了预测准确性和客户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中协作公平性是一个关键挑战，现有方法常忽略不平衡协变量偏移的复杂性。

Method: FedAKD结合客户端和服务器更新，采用异步知识蒸馏策略，先更新客户端模型，再选择高置信度样本更新全局模型。

Result: 在公开数据集和真实EHR数据集上，FedAKD显著提升了协作公平性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: FedAKD是一种简单有效的方法，适用于高度异构数据分布下的联邦学习。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

*Vincenzo Dentamaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，用于高效处理长序列，显著降低计算成本且不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的高计算成本问题。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源。

Conclusion: WERSA为长序列处理提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的硬件。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量深度学习模型在验证数据上遗忘率的分数，揭示了局部过拟合现象，并提出了一种两阶段方法（知识融合与蒸馏）来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中很少见。研究发现局部过拟合现象，即性能退化仅发生在数据空间的某些区域。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 将检查点聚合为集成模型；2) 通过知识蒸馏将其压缩为原始大小的单一模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在标签噪声情况下表现优于原始模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了训练和推理复杂度的双赢，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Motivation: 由于AI算法的黑盒特性及传统数据驱动分析中领域知识不足，AI在热电厂的应用受限。

Method: 开发了MAD-OPT框架，通过马氏距离约束引入领域知识，并应用于395 MW燃气轮机系统。

Result: MAD-OPT能估计不同环境条件下的最优工艺条件，且结果稳健；还能估计超出设计限制的最优条件，与实际数据相符。

Conclusion: 数据驱动优化需结合领域知识，否则可能产生无效解。MAD-OPT为热电厂安全采用AI提供了新途径。

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Motivation: 现有逆向强化学习方法假设专家演示可用，但现实中常为次优演示，且不适用于长时程或对抗性任务。

Method: 提出SPLASH方法，结合偏好学习和分层演示，适用于长时程和对抗性任务。

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，SPLASH显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLASH填补了逆向强化学习在次优演示和复杂任务中的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: 研究PMD框架中两种正则化技术的实际效果及其相互作用，填补理论与实证之间的空白。

Method: 在小型RL环境中运行超过50万次训练种子，分析距离项和MDP正则化的组合效果。

Result: 两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确组合对实现稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在RL中开发更稳健算法的重要性，尤其是对超参数敏感性的改进。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: 在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中验证了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控框架，能够有效检测模型性能的临界点，为模型维护提供支持。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

TL;DR: BlockFFN是一种新型的MoE架构，通过改进路由设计和训练目标，解决了传统MoE在性能和加速上的不足，显著提升了稀疏性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制不可微分且不灵活，导致性能下降；同时，稀疏模式不利于低资源条件下的加速。

Method: 提出BlockFFN架构，使用ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器，设计CLS感知的训练目标，并实现高效的加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性（TLS>80%，CLS>70%）和加速性能（3.67倍速度提升）上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: BlockFFN通过改进路由和稀疏性设计，显著提升了MoE模型的性能和加速能力，适用于低资源设备。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘会因学习新任务而覆盖旧任务的知识，影响模型性能。现有正则化方法试图约束重要参数，但效果有限。

Method: 在训练末期平台期跟踪参数活动，选择高活跃度的参数，因其在损失空间中方向平坦，适合适应新任务同时保留旧知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在缓解灾难性遗忘和保持新任务性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过关注训练末期参数活动，能更有效地平衡新旧任务的学习。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Result: 新模型显著提升了对抗表面操纵的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需开发更可靠的LLM评估方法，并发布了改进后的模型和训练数据。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型在噪声和高维数据下表现更优，且更易于调参。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的潜力，尤其是在高维问题和噪声环境下的优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Conclusion: CGKN框架统一了科学机器学习和数据同化，并展示了其在设计优化、反问题和最优控制等应用中的潜力。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过剪枝有效缓解硬件资源膨胀，硬件互连（扇出）对成本影响显著。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Conclusion: 结论指出，因果抽象不足以支持机制可解释性，未来需研究信息编码假设与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.
