Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS).

Our analysis\nreveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency\ninformation, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and\nvisual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose\na wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework\nthat explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency\ncomponents. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures\nwhile preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in\ncurrent latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware\noptimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for\napplications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging."}

A tell-tale watermarking\nsystem is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of\ntransformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks\nare tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner\nthat is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable.

To\naddress these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.\nHowever, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to\nrobustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image\nquality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close\ndistances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained\nmanipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel\nmethod specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in\neasing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing\nthe concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference\nsubspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the\ntarget concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct\nextensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity\nerasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results\nwith current state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, researchers\nhave successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\nprogrammatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based\npolicies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.\nInspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating\nprogrammatic policies in multi-player games.

The framework comprises four modules:\nGlobal Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool\npreserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool\nstores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently\nhigh-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The\nPolicy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top\nthree policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the\ncurrent iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy\nusing feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited\ninto the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves\na sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it\nis integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction\ndata from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes\ndirectional improvements to guide the Policy Planner"}

We propose Search based Embedding\nPoisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully\noptimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP\nleverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to\nharmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window\nthat evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP\nachieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task\nperformance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal\na critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for\nembedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies."}

The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order\nof likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a\nsophisticated Grover search.\n  We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its\nruntime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\\alpha}(\\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy\nwith parameter $\\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an\ninformation theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so\nfar been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the\nruntime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) <\nH_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a\nsuper-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing.\n  As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in\na multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys\nsampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction\nof them. For product distributions $D = \\chi^n$, we show that any constant\nfraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$\nquantumly per key, where $H(\\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast,\nArikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$\nclassically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) <\nH_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key\nis substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and\nquantumly."}

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior.

We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable\ncontinued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust\nin-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning\nfor broader chat workflows.\n  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural\ncausal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a\nrandom-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM\nto strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a\ntoken-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and\ndelivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.\n  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),\nMachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an\naverage of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across\nfinance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains.

Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to\nconventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using\nminimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer\nis a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these\ntransactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing\nneeds less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data\navailability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their\ncorresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and\nDACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential\nsecurity threat and delaying L2 adoption.

Although extensive\nmethods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,\nrejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents\na key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and\nsecurity, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we\npropose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically\nallocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions\nof security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial\npotential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy\nand performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved\nMoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and\nhidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly\nclassifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during\nrouter optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong\nadaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including\nmainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs\noptimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for\nuser interpretability.

Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty."}

While GANs have been\nwidely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer\nvision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and\nonly a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of\nthe most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on\noptimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)\nsetting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we\nfocus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG\nsetting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs\nwhen the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.\nTo extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein\nframework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly\nprojected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original\n(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically\noptimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our\nclosed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both\nGaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component\nanalysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve\nthe same performance while requiring less computational resources."}

Results: The model\nachieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,\nwhere predicted scores were aggregated.

Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic.

While this approach can detect obfuscated malware\nmore effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D\nimages results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,\ncaused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D\ndependencies which do not exist in the original data.

More concerningly, our analysis\nof frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing\nuncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through\nthis analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is\nlargely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used\nfor sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security\nnarrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy,\ndespite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and\nsuggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems."}

We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured\ninto four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,\nII) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and\nIV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,\nEfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance\nwith Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute\nerror (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS\nfrom two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed\n3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227\nvalidation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our\njoint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,\nViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can\nsignificantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge\nof joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,\nreduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and\naids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions."}

This critical issue is often\noverlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive\nand computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we\nintroduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,\nbackpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model\ngeneralization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural\nadapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time\ndevice data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data\ndistributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The\nprototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,\nfacilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer\nknowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter\nchanges and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and\nrecommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and\ngenerality."}
