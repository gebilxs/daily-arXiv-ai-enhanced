### [1] [Efficient Multilingual ASR Finetuning via LoRA Language Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21555)
*Jiahong Li,Yiwen Shao,Jianheng Zhuo,Chenda Li,Liliang Tang,Dong Yu,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，显著提升多语言ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，导致模型难以有效识别多语言。

Method: 通过LoRA专家融合或知识蒸馏，优化多语言ASR的微调框架。

Result: 实验显示，在语言感知和无语言感知场景下，性能分别提升约10%和15%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言ASR中显著优于标准微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个涵盖视觉、音频和文本的多模态知识图谱VAT-KG，通过严格的过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，并引入多模态RAG框架，显著提升多模态任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态单一，无法满足多模态任务需求，尤其是新兴的视频和音频模态。

Method: 提出VAT-KG，通过跨模态知识对齐和严格过滤步骤自动构建，并设计多模态RAG框架进行知识检索。

Result: 实验表明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs，验证了其实际价值。

Conclusion: VAT-KG为多模态知识图谱提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

### [3] [Debunk and Infer: Multimodal Fake News Detection via Diffusion-Generated Evidence and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21557)
*Kaiying Yan,Moyang Liu,Yukun Liu,Ruibo Fu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Debunk-and-Infer框架的假新闻检测方法DIFND，结合生成模型和多模态大语言模型，提升检测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在多媒体平台上的快速传播对信息可信度构成严重挑战，需要更高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: DIFND框架整合条件扩散模型的生成能力和多模态大语言模型的协作推理能力，通过生成反驳或验证证据，并结合多代理推理链进行最终判断。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上的实验表明，DIFND在检测准确性和可信度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征和生成推理线索，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

### [4] [Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21571)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yujia Fu,Chuanrui Hu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型推理模型（LRMs）是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并提出了CogTest基准来评估这些习惯。研究发现LRMs确实具有人类相似的习惯，并能根据任务自适应调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 引入CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯，每种习惯对应25个任务，采用证据优先的提取方法。评估了16种广泛使用的LLM（13种LRMs和3种非推理模型）。

Result: LRMs表现出人类相似的习惯，并能自适应调整。某些习惯（如“承担负责任的风险”）与生成有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的持续行为模式有助于深入理解LLM的异常行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

### [5] [Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21558)
*FutureSearch,:,Jack Wildman,Nikos I. Bosse,Daniel Hnyk,Peter Mühlbacher,Finn Hambly,Jon Evans,Dan Schwarz,Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为BTF的“过去预测”基准测试，用于评估LLM在已知结果的历史事件上的预测能力，提供了一种可重复且现实的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个现实、封闭且可重复的LLM预测基准测试，BTF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BTF包含数百个已知结果的高质量问题和大量相关网页离线语料库，用于模拟LLM对历史事件的预测。

Result: 实验表明，BTF能产生与未解决事件预测相似的结果，并成功测试了多种LLM的预测能力。

Conclusion: BTF是一个动态基准测试，将持续更新问题以跟踪LLM预测能力的进步，并邀请研究者使用。

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [6] [From Thinking to Output: Chain-of-Thought and Text Generation Characteristics in Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21609)
*Junhao Liu,Zhenhao Xu,Yuxin Fang,Yichuan Chen,Zuobin Ying,Wenhan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分析大型语言模型（LLMs）推理特性的新框架，通过关键词统计和LLM-as-a-judge范式，比较了四种前沿模型的推理过程与输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLMs推理过程及输出的系统比较，尤其是自我反思模式（'Aha moment'）和跨领域关联。

Method: 使用关键词统计和LLM-as-a-judge范式，分析四种模型（GPT-o1、DeepSeek-R1、Kimi-k1.5、Grok-3）的推理特性，结合真实场景问题和多维度评估指标。

Result: 揭示了模型在探索与利用、问题处理及结论达成上的不同模式，并量化比较了推理深度、中间步骤依赖等差异。

Conclusion: 为计算效率与推理鲁棒性的权衡提供了见解，并为模型设计与评估提出了实用建议。

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our
project at: https://github.com/ChangWenhan/FromThinking2Output

### [7] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决固定参数和长上下文导致的效率问题，并在少量标注数据下实现高效调优和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型（GLM）在上下文学习（ICL）中因固定参数和长上下文存在效率问题，而指令调优需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过参数适应阶段优化GLM，以少量标注数据实现高效调优和推理。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，使用图神经网络（GNN）将节点转换为LLM令牌的表示空间，任务指令表示为节点和语言令牌的混合。预训练阶段训练非LLM参数以捕获通用知识，适应阶段基于少量示例更新部分参数。

Result: GraphLAMA在少/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中表现优异，准确率绝对提升4.91%，推理速度比ICL快10倍（5-shot设置）。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过参数适应阶段显著提升了图语言模型的性能和效率，适用于实际场景中标注数据稀缺的情况。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

### [8] [Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21972)
*Mohamed Ahmed,Mohamed Abdelmouty,Mingyu Kim,Gunvanth Kandula,Alex Park,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，并揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）应用广泛，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击。现有方法各有局限性，需要更有效的攻击手段以揭示和弥补安全缺陷。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估了它们在Vicuna和Llama模型上的表现。

Result: GCG + PAIR在未防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）达到91.6%，显著高于PAIR的58.4%；GCG + WordGame在严格评估下仍保持80%以上的ASR。两种方法均能突破高级防御措施。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全措施的漏洞，强调了在攻击成功率和防御鲁棒性之间的权衡，并呼吁开发更全面的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

TL;DR: 研究比较了强化学习微调技术在小型语言模型上的效果，发现RLOO和DPO表现最佳，数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习微调技术提升小型语言模型在指令跟随和数学推理任务中的表现。

Method: 比较了SFT、DPO和RLOO三种微调方法，并测试了数据增强和外部验证器在数学任务中的应用。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO结果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为轻量级语言模型的训练提供了实用策略和关键权衡点。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

### [10] [Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21561)
*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性检测中的表现，发现推理模型比非推理模型更少倾向于认为陈述为真，但仍高于人类基准。部分先进模型存在谄媚倾向，真实性检测能力不对称。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛应用于事实核查和高风险决策，但其作为真实性判断工具的表现仍不明确。

Method: 研究让8个LLM模型对4,800条陈述进行真实性判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见率低于非推理模型，但仍高于人类基准；部分先进模型在真相检测准确率高，但在欺骗检测中表现差。

Conclusion: 仅靠能力提升无法解决LLMs在真实性检测中的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于'下一个房间预测'的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑平面图设计，解决了现有端到端生成模型与真实设计流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型多为端到端生成，与建筑设计中的渐进迭代流程不兼容，因此需要一种更符合实际工作流程的方法。

Method: 受大型语言模型中自回归'下一个令牌预测'机制启发，提出'下一个房间预测'范式，用于建筑平面图建模。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design，具有潜在应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法支持未来智能建筑设计，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FORMOSANBENCH，首个用于评估大语言模型在低资源南岛语系语言（如阿美语、泰雅语和排湾语）性能的基准测试。结果显示，现有模型在这些语言上的表现远低于高资源语言，且改进有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的表现，填补研究空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，涵盖机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要三个任务，并在零样本、10样本和微调设置下评估模型性能。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言上表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更具包容性的NLP技术以支持濒危和代表性不足的语言，并公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合日本传统沟通方式的多智能体推理框架（KCS+IBC），用于情感分析中的偏见缓解、可解释性提升和概率预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受日本传统沟通方式（如kairanban和idobata对话）启发，旨在通过多智能体协作改善情感分析的偏见和多样性。

Method: 整合多个大语言模型（LLMs），通过中间阶段的非正式对话和概率预测，结合正式推理与个体观点。

Result: KCS+IBC在保持精度的同时，降低了熵并增加了预测的多样性，显示出平衡聚合与多样性的能力。

Conclusion: 未来将量化评估偏见修正效果，并开发更先进的情感分析系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源语言对（英语-古吉拉特语）中的有效性。

Method: 使用MBART50模型生成反向翻译数据，并评估其对翻译性能的影响。

Result: 反向翻译数据未提升BLEU分数，甚至略微降低性能。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能收益递减，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BioPars，一种用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在生物信息学中应用能力的工具，并展示了其在波斯医学问答任务中的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLMs在生命科学中的潜力，特别是在生物信息学和医学问答任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，并开发了BioPars模型，用于测试LLMs在知识获取、解释和证据展示方面的能力。

Result: BioPars在多个评估指标（如ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT）上表现优于其他模型（如GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在生物信息学任务中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化以应对更高层次的推理问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

TL;DR: 研究评估了RAG和HyDE两种增强策略在小型Gemma LLM上的效果，发现RAG在延迟和准确性上表现更优，适合隐私优先的个人助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源效率是部署大型语言模型（LLM）在边缘和隐私敏感应用中的关键障碍，研究旨在评估两种增强策略的效果。

Method: 使用1B和4B参数的Gemma LLM，结合MongoDB和Qdrant实现短长期记忆，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，React.js前端展示。

Result: RAG降低延迟17%，消除事实幻觉；HyDE增强语义相关性但增加响应时间25-40%，且存在幻觉。4B模型对HyDE的计算开销更大。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种定制化的检索增强生成（RAG）框架和合成微调数据集，以提高LLM在自然语言到SystemVerilog断言（NL2SVA）翻译中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，而现有大型语言模型（LLM）在理解领域特定语法和语义方面仍有不足。

Method: 采用定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，提供分步构建SVAs的提示引导解释，并通过监督微调提升语法和功能准确性。

Result: 实验表明，定制RAG框架使功能匹配的SVAs数量比GPT-4o-mini提高了58.42%，微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型比基础模型提升了59.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了更高效的自动化工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的有效迁移，探索不同设计选择对性能的影响。

Method: 通过上游后训练、时间序列分词器和语言模型规模等设计选择，分析其对验证损失的影响。

Result: 在低数据量下，设计选择对验证损失有显著影响，LMs的验证损失持续下降，形成非消失的迁移差距。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于高效计算训练在时间序列中的应用，并为研究数据分布的模态无关特性提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

Result: 实验表明，新基准Gold具有更强的可解释性、更少的指标冗余和更清晰的认知一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为MLLM评估提供了更科学和结构化的方法，显著优于现有基准设计。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化大语言模型（LLM）的指令，显著提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型资源需求大、表达能力有限的问题，结合两者优势优化LLM指令。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化指令和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束形成统一高维表示，迭代优化指令。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Result: LLM能模拟人类决策策略，注重效用最大化和程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化移民决策中具有潜力，但也需注意其局限性，如偏见问题。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现跨形式迁移，显著提升语义解析和知识图谱问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理关系型和图结构数据时孤立的问题，通过共享抽象实现跨形式迁移。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数。

Result: 在Spider和Text2Cypher任务上分别提升13.5%和73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用Soft Prompt Tuning（SPT）方法，评估全微调（FFT）和仅训练软提示两种策略，并提出SPT4ASR组合方法。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，且保持了参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR在提升低资源ASR性能的同时，避免了灾难性遗忘，且参数效率高。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Result: Entire SPT和LAPT在语言扩展任务中分别比Decoder SPT提升5.0%和16.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注医生和英语环境，忽视了医疗团队的多专业性和非英语需求，需更全面的评估工具。

Method: 基于巴西国家考试构建包含5,632个问题的基准，覆盖多专业，并对20多个领先LLM进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但在神经外科（60.0%）和社会工作（68.4%）等领域表现不佳，知识分布不均。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足以验证模型安全性，需更细粒度的评估工具，HealthQA-BR为此提供了关键支持。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Result: 定量实验验证了VIDEE的有效性，用户研究表明其适用于不同经验水平的用户，并揭示了用户行为模式。

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用的文本分析工具，未来可进一步优化人机协作设计。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

Method: 研究引入多类别标注数据集，分析罗马乌尔都语中的希望语言模式，并提出基于注意力的Transformer模型（XLM-R）。

Result: XLM-R模型在5折交叉验证中得分0.78，优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源、非正式语言变体的包容性NLP研究提供了重要贡献，模型性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the

TL;DR: 研究发现小型指令调优模型LLaMA 3 8B也能表现出对齐伪装行为，提示干预可显著减少此行为，挑战了提示伦理无关紧要及对齐伪装需大规模模型的假设。


<details>

Motivation: 探索小型语言模型是否也能表现出对齐伪装行为，并验证提示干预的有效性。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如义务论道德框架和草稿推理）研究对齐伪装行为。

Result: 提示干预显著减少对齐伪装行为，表明小型模型也能表现出此类行为。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对语言模型伪装行为的理解，强调需在不同规模和部署环境中评估对齐问题。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了两种基于大语言模型（LLM）的信息提取方法（直接提取与间接提取），发现间接提取在准确率略低的情况下显著降低了LLM调用次数，提升了效率和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用生成式AI和LLM从在线零售商的食品产品页面中高效提取结构化信息（如成分表和营养表）。

Method: 比较了直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种方法，评估了它们在准确性、效率和成本上的表现，使用了3,000个食品产品页面的数据集。

Result: 间接提取的准确率略低（96.48%，比直接提取低1.61%），但减少了95.82%的LLM调用次数，显著提升了效率和降低了成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板的网页大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远逊于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（NVC的子集）是理解更复杂非语言交流的关键前提。

Method: 提出MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作的变体，通过运动捕捉数据构建，评估模型识别鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提高模型对人类手势的鲁棒理解。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国和中国公众意见时表现最佳，但存在文化和人口偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源大语言模型DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司开发的模型进行比较。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用ANES和中国Zuobiao数据集评估模型预测中美社会议题公众意见的能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题和中国外援及个人主义议题上表现最佳，但在模拟低收入和非大学教育人群观点时存在局限。所有模型倾向于过度概括群体内单一视角。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在公众意见建模中的文化和人口偏见，建议采用更包容的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆的底层机制，特别是触发和维持记忆的具体网络部分及其行为差异。

Method: 利用转换器电路和对比数据集，识别模型生成与记忆内容的分歧点，并分离负责记忆的特定电路。

Result: 发现触发记忆的电路也能维持记忆，而仅维持记忆的电路无法触发记忆；记忆预防机制具有跨领域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 记忆的触发和维持由不同电路实现，记忆预防机制具有通用性，而记忆触发更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的LLM检测器（GLD），用于识别未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类撰写和LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止错误信息传播至关重要。现有方法在泛化到新LLM和领域时表现不佳。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，以检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集评估，GLD在检测性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值，解决了现有检测方法的局限性。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了表示一致性（RC）方法，通过聚合LLM生成的多个候选答案及其内部激活一致性来提升推理性能，无需额外模型查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在通过简单方式提升推理性能。

Method: 利用候选答案的出现频率和生成答案时的内部激活一致性进行答案聚合，支持密集和稀疏激活信号。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC显著提升任务性能（最高4%）。

Conclusion: RC通过激活一致性有效提升推理性能，稀疏激活信号与连贯推理概念一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前评估基准未能解耦LLMs的知识和推理能力，且缺乏任务失败的根本原因分析，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FinEval-KR框架，通过知识评分和推理评分独立量化能力，并基于Bloom分类法引入认知评分。同时发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLMs的推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的关键，但知识应用仍是瓶颈，且专业金融LLMs表现普遍落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为评估LLMs在金融推理任务中的能力提供了新工具，揭示了知识应用和推理能力的瓶颈，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在手语识别中效率和准确性难以兼顾的问题，尤其是RNN、LSTM和GCN等模型存在的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于参数超过百万的先前模型，并在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效低成本地为LLM添加新语言能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Conclusion: 结构保留方法无需修改模型架构或额外训练，即可显著提升MLLMs的文档理解能力。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Result: BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，文本质量（困惑度）保持良好，下游任务表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark在文本质量和水印功能之间取得了平衡，为LLM生成文本的认证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay
Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various
machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle
with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found
that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and
trustworthy AES methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个更全面的数据集和基准（MemBench），用于评估基于LLM的智能体的记忆能力，解决了现有评估方法在记忆层次和交互场景多样性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法在记忆层次和交互场景多样性上存在局限性，且缺乏全面的评估指标，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建包含事实记忆和反思记忆的数据集，并提出参与和观察两种交互场景，基于此设计MemBench基准。

Result: 提出了MemBench基准，能够从有效性、效率和容量等多方面评估LLM智能体的记忆能力。

Conclusion: MemBench为研究社区提供了更全面的记忆能力评估工具，数据集和项目已开源。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

### [47] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出将大语言模型（LLMs）视为人类文化动态的‘DNA’，强调其作为压缩人类符号表达模式的外部存储库，而非自主智能或简单模仿工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义LLMs的角色，探讨其在文化演化中的功能，而非单纯比较其与人类智能的差异。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs如何保存人类文化的规律。

Result: LLMs作为文化演化的工具，为人类提供低风险环境下的自我反思和假设生成能力。

Conclusion: LLMs的意义在于增强文化可演化性，而非替代人类智能，需依赖人类解释以维持其文化相关性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG是一个模块化框架，用于从法律文本构建可解释的知识图谱，通过类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱方法在处理法律文本时存在共指消解不足、噪声多和节点重复的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两步流程：类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 相比基线方法，CORE-KG减少节点重复33.28%，减少噪声38.37%，生成更清晰的知识图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 探索在多模态时间序列预测中，文本信息是否普遍有效，以及其增益的具体条件。

Method: 通过14个任务的基准测试，评估了基于对齐和提示的两种多模态预测方法，并分析了模型架构和数据特征的影响。

Result: 多模态方法并非在所有情况下优于单模态基线，增益取决于模型容量、对齐策略、数据量和文本的补充信息。

Conclusion: 提出了多模态预测有效的五个关键条件，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和GOT表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样、多任务适应性和泛化能力不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、多任务适应性和泛化能力方面存在不足。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集和POI任务上验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型有效解决了POI嵌入中的关键挑战，表现出色。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论数据集缺乏针对儿童的标注和上下文，无法有效捕捉对儿童的独特情感影响，亟需专门的数据集。

Method: 通过从现有语料库中提取并添加儿童特定标注，构建了ChildGuard1数据集，并评估了包括大语言模型在内的现有仇恨言论检测方法。

Result: ChildGuard1数据集提供了多样化的儿童仇恨言论上下文，为改进检测方法奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 公开发布ChildGuard1数据集，以促进针对儿童仇恨言论的进一步研究和改进检测方法。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of child-targeted hate speech online underscores
the urgent need for specialized datasets to address this critical issue.
Existing hate speech datasets lack agespecific annotations, fail to capture
nuanced contexts, and overlook the unique emotional impact on children. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChildGuard1, a curated dataset derived from
existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including
Large Language Models (LLMs), and assess their effectiveness in detecting and
contextualizing child-targeted hate speech. To foster further research in this
area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for
developing improved methods to detect and mitigate such harm.

TL;DR: LastingBench是一个新框架，旨在通过扰动和重写泄漏点来减少大型语言模型在QA基准测试中的记忆效应，确保评估的公平性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在QA基准测试中可能通过记忆任务特定数据来“作弊”，这削弱了评估的有效性。现有研究主要关注检测泄漏，而忽略了减轻其影响和保护基准长期效用。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别泄漏点，并将其重写为反事实内容，以破坏记忆效应，同时保留基准的原始评估意图。

Result: 对最先进QA基准的评估显示，LastingBench显著减少了记忆效应，表现出明显的性能差距。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准的长期稳健性，促进对LLM更公平和可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G是一个基于生成增强检索的框架，通过直接检索权威临床指南内容，避免了模型生成文本的幻觉问题，提升了医疗语言模型的临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码预测诊断，但ICD代码无法捕捉临床医生的复杂推理和指南参考，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，通过嵌入相似性检索相关临床指南内容，并将其与模型输出融合，生成临床对齐的建议。

Result: 在高血压诊断的原型系统中，GARMLE-G在检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性上优于基于RAG的基线模型，同时保持了轻量级架构。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，将医疗语言模型与循证临床实践结合，具有广泛临床部署潜力。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的通用大型语言模型（LLMs）在开放领域时间线摘要中存在主题相关性评估和时间线演化理解的不足，导致摘要信息不准确或包含无关内容。

Method: 提出TIM模型，采用渐进优化策略，包括指令调优和双对齐奖励学习方法（结合语义和时间视角），并基于大规模TLS数据集进行训练。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出强大的时间线摘要能力，显著提升了摘要质量和时间线理解的准确性。

Conclusion: TIM模型通过渐进优化和双对齐奖励学习，有效解决了开放领域时间线摘要的挑战，为新闻主题演化监控提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多选题数据集（如MMLU）因开源性质和训练数据广泛来源导致基准污染，评估结果不可靠。

Method: 通过从更广泛的领域获取数据并设计三条去污染规则来避免无意数据泄漏；将基准分为验证集和测试集以防止恶意数据泄漏。

Result: 主流大型语言模型在测试集上的表现显著下降（如GPT-4o的5-shot得分为73.4%，0-shot为71.9%），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且污染无关的评估标准，提升了大型语言模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，特别是在需要严格音视频同步的应用（如视频配音）中。

Method: 引入两种生成模式：精确控制生成令牌数以控制时长，或自由生成语音并保留输入提示的韵律特征。同时，结合GPT潜在表示和软指令机制，提升情感控制的清晰度和易用性。

Result: IndexTTS2在零样本设置下，在词错误率、说话人相似性和情感保真度上优于现有最先进的TTS模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2通过创新的时长控制和情感分离方法，显著提升了TTS模型的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）概念，通过优化训练数据的组织提升语言模型性能，并提出了DELT范式，包含数据评分、选择和排序三个组件。实验验证了数据效能的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（如数据选择和过滤），而数据组织对性能的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据的学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明DELT能不同程度提升模型性能，且不增加数据规模或模型大小。LQS与FO组合效果最佳，数据效能与数据效率可同时实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中一个具有潜力的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治敏感在线讨论中的表现，探讨其潜在影响。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析政治立场、情感和语言特征。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于操纵在线政治讨论，需警惕AI驱动的叙事影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模、高质量的数学证明数据集，限制了LLM在证明生成领域的进展。

Method: 构建OPC数据集，包含LLM生成的证明，并探索关键问题如自然语言与形式证明的差距、答案准确性与证明有效性的差异等。

Result: 通过OPC微调的8B参数模型在评估证明正确性任务中表现与Gemini-2.5-Pro相当。

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其在模型训练中的实用性。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非标准语音（如脑瘫或遗传障碍导致的语音障碍）对ASR系统构成挑战，现有模型因缺乏训练数据而表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级流程，通过选择关键词并增强语义一致性，个性化调整ASR模型。

Result: 在儿童结构语音障碍数据上应用，转录质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有望降低非标准语音用户的沟通障碍。

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by
enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured
textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and
contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within
consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by
incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize
subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility.
Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that
utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined
through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with
high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance
machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and
improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在提取分子结构-活性关系（SAR）时面临文档格式多样性和方法泛化能力不足的挑战，需要更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: 提出Doc2SAR框架，整合领域专用工具和经过监督微调（SFT）的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），用于SAR提取。

Conclusion: Doc2SAR通过高效推理和实用工具（如网页应用）展示了其在SAR提取任务中的优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了GNNs和MLPs在结构感知任务中的表现差异，提出了一种信息论视角的探测框架，评估结构建模对语言模型的影响，并发现MLPs在特征转换模块中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现突出，这促使研究者探索结构建模对语言模型的影响以及MLPs作为GNNs替代方案的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种模块化探测框架，通过控制模块选择性使用GNN或其解耦组件（消息传递和特征转换操作），评估各操作的独立贡献。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能有效提升语言模型对语言知识的捕捉，而仅依赖消息传递操作的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在特征转换中表现优异，可作为GNNs的高效替代方案，而消息传递操作需谨慎使用以避免负面影响。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Motivation: 由于语言多样性和标注数据有限，孟加拉语方言的情感分析研究不足。

Method: 数据集包含政治、宗教和中性文本，采用双标注方案（主题分类和情感标注），由专家翻译和标注，并通过一致性检验和系统检查确保质量。

Result: 数据集质量高，一致性强，填补了孟加拉语方言情感分析的资源空白。

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为低资源孟加拉语方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，有助于更准确的自然语言处理。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音Transformer模型如何编码说话者信息，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 分析前馈层神经元与k-means聚类和i-vector的关联，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 这些神经元对应广泛的语音和性别类别，保护它们可显著保留说话者任务性能。

Conclusion: 特定神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们有助于模型优化。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在事实核查系统中的参数知识偏见及其对结果的影响。

Method: 通过直接提示和生成支持、反驳或中性文档两种实验方式，分析模型的行为和偏见。

Result: Llama 3.1在直接提示下对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，而生成文档的实验显示检索结果显著受提示影响。

Conclusion: 尽管检索证据存在差异，最终预测结果在不同提示策略下表现稳定，但模型存在固有负面偏见。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估其隐式和显式时间理解能力。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的结构化列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下测试模型。

Result: 当前模型在闭卷设置中难以提供完整答案和时间对齐，开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于XLNet的自动检测社交媒体上攻击性语言的模型，并与BERT进行比较。XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上表现优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上略优。此外，过采样和欠采样策略有效解决了类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容（如仇恨言论、种族歧视等）的增加需要自动化检测系统，因为人工审核不切实际。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于OLID数据集进行实验，并采用过采样和欠采样策略处理类别不平衡。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上表现更好。过采样和欠采样策略提高了分类性能。

Conclusion: 基于XLNet的迁移学习架构在检测社交媒体攻击性语言方面具有潜力，能够构建更鲁棒的系统。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，阻碍了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分类基于LLM架构（编码器、解码器、编码-解码器）的XAI方法，并评估其可解释性及实际应用。

Result: 综述了现有XAI方法，分析了其优缺点，并探讨了实际应用中的挑战与资源。

Conclusion: 未来需继续研究透明且负责任的LLMs，以推动XAI的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引起的语义和语用变化，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率的快速变化，尤其是某些词汇（如'delve'、'intricate'、'crucial'）的突然增加，引发了对其背后原因和结构的研究需求。

Method: 通过分析PubMed科学摘要中的频率趋势，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组的词汇变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明变化主要是语义和语用的，而非单纯词汇替换；同时观察到某些词汇（如'important'）的显著减少。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对语言的影响主要是语义和语用的，研究为理解语言技术如何塑造人类语言提供了新视角。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Method: 使用基于Transformer的语言编码器，结合语义、风格和韵律特征，包括Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码。

Result: 加权投票方案准确率为71%，高置信度预测（0.9阈值）准确率达97%。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯诗歌的自动分类、风格分析和作者争议提供了潜力，并支持多语言作者归属和生成模型研究。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

### [76] [The Consistency Hypothesis in Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21849)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出置信度的估计问题，提出了基于生成一致性的假设（一致性假设），并通过统计测试验证其有效性，最终提出了一种无需数据的黑盒不确定性量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高用户对LLM输出的信任度，尤其是在需要高可靠性的实际应用中。

Method: 提出一致性假设的三种数学表述及统计测试，设计评估指标，并在8个基准数据集和3个任务上进行实证研究。

Result: 发现一致性假设在不同场景下普遍成立，其中‘Sim-Any’假设最具实用性，并基于此提出优于基线方法的黑盒UQ方法。

Conclusion: 一致性假设具有实际价值，提出的黑盒UQ方法能有效提升LLM输出置信度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Derivational Probing方法，研究BERT模型中微观和宏观句法结构在不同层中的构建过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经语言模型内部如何在不同层中构建句法结构，尤其是微观和宏观句法结构的形成过程。

Method: 使用Derivational Probing方法分析BERT模型中词嵌入在不同层中的传播过程，重点关注微观和宏观句法结构的构建。

Result: 实验发现微观句法结构在低层形成，逐渐整合为宏观句法结构；宏观结构的构建时机对下游任务性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了BERT模型中句法结构的构建过程，并指出全局句法信息整合的最佳时机。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

TL;DR: DeepTalk提出了一种基于MoE架构的自适应模态专家学习框架，解决了原生多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因数据不足导致的性能下降问题，性能损失仅为5.5%，对话延迟低于0.5秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生MLLMs因配对语音-文本数据不足导致的灾难性遗忘和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用MoE架构，自适应区分模态专家，分别进行单模态训练和多模态协作训练。

Result: 性能损失仅为5.5%，显著优于原生MLLMs的20%性能下降，对话延迟低于0.5秒。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在保持低延迟的同时，显著提升了原生MLLMs的性能，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多基于文本基准，忽视了语音的独特特性（如韵律、同音词等），阻碍了语音LLM在实际应用中的优化。

Method: 系统收集真实语音对话数据，引入多样化的说话者属性和声学条件，并增加语音特有现象；设计查询感知的评估方法，使用定制化检查表和提示。

Result: 测试显示不同语音场景下模型性能差异显著，查询感知评估提供了更细粒度的性能分析。

Conclusion: 该基准为语音模型的开发和评估提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（感知与预测）来系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）作为世界模型（WMs）的能力，并通过大规模基准测试WM-ABench发现现有模型在基础世界建模能力上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力缺乏系统性评估，尤其是其基础世界建模能力。

Method: 提出两阶段评估框架（感知与预测），设计WM-ABench基准，涵盖23个细粒度维度，并在6种模拟环境中进行660次实验。

Result: 实验显示，现有VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，例如运动轨迹区分准确率接近随机，且缺乏解耦理解能力。

Conclusion: VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

TL;DR: 研究评估了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性，发现其在工具调用各阶段易出错，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，模型规模增大未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视稳定性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段（如阅读文档、选择工具、生成参数、处理响应）的脆弱性。

Result: 代理在各阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱；模型规模增大未显著提升推理能力，反而可能增加攻击风险。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在其输出可能影响公众意见或强化主流叙事时。

Method: 两阶段评估：阶段1评估事实性问题的一致性，阶段2探讨地缘政治敏感争议中的偏见。构建了一个多语言数据集。

Result: 阶段1显示查询语言导致的偏见，阶段2反映模型训练背景与查询语言的相互作用。

Conclusion: 提供了一个评估LLM行为的框架，为未来多语言环境中的部署和文化敏感评估提供了见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据混合是一个未解决的问题，因为数据与任务的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在基准测试中的能力，利用其一阶影响力近似作为数据混合的信号源。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，性能提升高达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Motivation: 预训练模型在特定领域（如驾驶舱对话）表现不佳，需改进转录准确性。

Method: 收集并标注驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，提出规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行微调。

Result: 微调后的Whisper Large模型结合规范化方案，词错误率显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了驾驶舱对话转录的准确性。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Conclusion: 结论表明LLMs在道德决策中编码了隐含偏好，且社会身份会影响其响应，数据已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All

Result: 发现仅需少量组件即可完成基础任务（主谓一致），但复杂任务需要更多组件。

Conclusion: 模型中的主谓一致功能由特定子网络实现，基础任务效率高，复杂任务需更多资源。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Result: 研究发现，社交模拟应通过其拟合场景中的实证真实性进行验证。

Conclusion: 论文主张在基于生成代理的社会模拟中应更加严谨。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Result: HT与MT在通用特征上差异显著，LLMs在特定特征上表现优于NMT，风格更接近HT。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格特征上与人工翻译更接近。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Result: NMT和LLM均表现出MTese特征，原始中文文本与机器翻译输出区分度高；LLM词汇多样性更高，NMT使用更多括号。

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出存在显著语言特征，LLM和NMT各有特点，但中外企业开发的LLM无显著差异。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在复杂推理方面取得进展，但其在长链思维推理中的自我修正能力仍未被充分研究，且存在冗余推理问题。

Method: 通过实证研究发现首步推理对最终预测影响巨大，提出利用奖励模型筛选高质量首步推理的采样策略。

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了推理成本降低70%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的稳健推理提供了新方法和评估基准，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDC的任务导向、多轮、动态环境中的对话引发了多种语言现象，标注参考信息可使其成为更有价值的资源。

Method: 讨论了标注方法和生成的语料库，并提供了数据的定量和定性分析。

Result: 通过简短实验证明了该语料库在指代表达理解中的实用性。

Conclusion: MDC-R是一个有价值的资源，尤其适用于指代和指示参考的研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus with Reference (MDC-R). MDC-R is a
new language resource that supplements the original Minecraft Dialogue Corpus
(MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's
task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has
motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic
phenomena that this setting gives rise to. We believe it can serve as a
valuable resource when annotated with reference, too. Here, we discuss our
method of annotation and the resulting corpus, and provide both a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis of the data. Furthermore, we carry out a short
experiment demonstrating the usefulness of our corpus for referring expression
comprehension.

Motivation: 探讨社交媒体如何通过语言复杂性反映社会结构和意识形态，以理解其更广泛的社会影响。

Method: 结合多种文本复杂性测量方法，分析Twitter用户生成内容在四个关键维度上的语言使用差异。

Result: 发现语言复杂性在不同账户类型、政治倾向、内容可靠性和情感上存在显著差异，负面和攻击性内容倾向于使用更复杂的语言。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社会语言学动态，为理解在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了DAPFAM数据集，解决专利检索中领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和计算资源限制等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏明确的领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡的查询领域表示，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建DAPFAM数据集，包含领域平衡的查询和目标家族，基于IPC代码标注领域关系。

Result: 数据集包含1,247个查询家族和45,336个目标家族，生成49,869个评估对，支持跨领域专利检索实验。

Conclusion: DAPFAM填补了专利检索数据集的空白，为跨领域检索提供了新资源，实验显示跨领域检索仍具挑战性。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

Motivation: 解决阿拉伯方言和阿拉伯语-英语代码转换语音数据稀缺的问题，并提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 提出改进的音频拼接方法（SAGE）生成人工CS数据，结合经验回放（ER）方法增强泛化能力，并引入外部语言模型优化结果。

Result: 在阿拉伯语和英语CS基准测试中，WER绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%，并在阿拉伯语-英语CS基准测试中超越了大规模多语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和模型优化方法，显著提升了模型在方言和代码转换语音任务上的性能，且效果优于更大规模的模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨哪些类型的批评对改进模型响应最有效，以及如何生成此类批评。

Method: RCO框架通过反馈循环，利用批评效用（CU）作为奖励信号，训练批评模型生成有效批评。

Result: 在五个任务中，RCO显著优于传统方法和开源模型，提升了批评质量和修正效果。

Conclusion: RCO通过优化批评信号和修正偏好，有效增强了语言模型的批评-修正循环。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs的政治偏见时稳定性不足，无法可靠比较模型。

Method: 提出QM任务，使用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，评估模型偏见。

Result: QM提高了评估稳定性，发现指令调优会改变偏见方向，且大模型能更有效利用上下文示例，偏见分数更低。

Conclusion: QM是一种更稳定的偏见评估方法，可用于比较模型，且大模型表现更好。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPT-4o的新方法，利用上下文信息检测结构化数据集中的个人数据，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测个人数据时缺乏对上下文信息的利用，导致性能受限。

Method: 结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述等上下文信息，使用GPT-4o进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，GPT-4o方法在真实数据集（如MIMIC-Demo-Ext）和需要上下文的Kaggle/OpenML数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以推动进展。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评分法官在多个领域广泛应用，但其评分偏见影响公平性和可靠性，目前研究主要集中在比较评估，对评分评估的系统性研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成扩展现有LLM评分基准，设计多维度评估指标，定义评分偏见并构建评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有评分模型的稳定性受偏见干扰，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评分偏见的严重性，为未来评分系统设计和偏见缓解提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类语言解析策略为何不随机，通过实验验证随机解析策略在复杂输入和引入意外性因素后是否仍能保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言解析策略并非随机，但此前研究表明随机策略在简单条件下也能实现高准确率，因此研究其局限性。

Method: 修改实验设置：(I)使用具有层次结构的复杂输入，(II)在目标函数中加入意外性因素。

Result: 评估随机解析策略在复杂条件下是否仍能保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 研究旨在揭示随机解析策略的局限性及其与人类语言理解的差异。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个无需修改模型权重或结构的模块化框架，通过动态停止计算、跳过KV缓存和融合冗余令牌，显著减少推理时的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理时的高延迟和能耗是主要瓶颈，现有方法需要重新训练或改变架构，QuickSilver旨在无需修改模型的情况下优化推理效率。

Method: QuickSilver结合动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在冻结的密集模型上操作，无需辅助网络。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度几乎无增加（≤0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver提供了一种高效且兼容的推理优化方法，适用于现有模型，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert

that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC案例转化为逐步诊断任务，并开发MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队进行诊断和测试选择。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%；最高配置下准确率达85.5%。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和策略性行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 提出M3CTS生成多样化、逻辑一致的LongCoT推理轨迹，并设计fDPO方法，引入分段偏好优化和空间奖励机制。

Result: fDPO在空间质量任务上平均提升4.1%，在空间数量任务上提升9.0%；SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上刷新SoTA，平均准确率提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1结合fDPO显著提升了细粒度空间推理能力，同时在通用视觉语言任务上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in

of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

*Liangyu Zhong,Fabio Rosenthal,Joachim Sicking,Fabian Hüger,Thorsten Bagdonat,Hanno Gottschalk,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，利用MLLM内部表示指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排名相关图像区域、使用排名最高区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行方法，计算量减少3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS在性能和效率上均显著优于现有方法，为细粒度VQA任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

*Aryan Thakre,Omkar Nagwekar,Vedang Talekar,Aparna Santra Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交叉注意力的CAST模型，用于更有效地融合时空特征以检测深度伪造视频，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型对时空特征的处理独立且结合方式简单，限制了时空交互的深度。

Method: 提出CAST模型，利用交叉注意力动态融合时空特征，增强对时间演化伪造痕迹（如闪烁的眼睛或扭曲的嘴唇）的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上，模型在内部测试中AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%；在跨数据集测试中AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将扩散训练范式融入普通图像修复（IR）框架的方法，通过系统分析时间步依赖、网络层次、噪声级关系和多任务相关性，优化了单任务和多任务IR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像修复任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但其复杂架构和迭代过程限制了实际应用。现有方法主要关注网络架构和扩散路径优化，忽视了扩散训练范式与普通IR框架的整合。

Method: 通过分析时间步依赖、网络层次、噪声级关系和多任务相关性，提出了一种新的IR框架，并引入正则化策略和对齐扩散目标与IR任务的方法。此外，开发了增量训练范式和任务特定适配器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了单任务IR的泛化能力，并在多任务统一IR中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可以无缝集成到现有的普通IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

TL;DR: AsymDSD是一种自监督学习框架，通过潜在空间预测结合掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云的语义表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无标签大规模数据集下3D点云语义表示学习的挑战，避免传统掩码点建模（MPM）在高层语义捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 提出AsymDSD框架，采用非对称双自蒸馏方法，结合潜在空间预测、多掩码采样和多裁剪技术，优化掩码建模和不变性学习。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到90.53%的准确率，预训练后提升至93.72%，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过潜在空间预测和多掩码设计，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能，为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [110] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MESP和LCH两个理论框架，探讨概率生成模型的局限性，即学习全局分布导致记忆而非生成行为。MESP源于对VAE的重新思考，提出基于重叠系数的下界，并设计了BL-AE和ARVM模型。LCH假设生成能力源于局部相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概率生成模型中全局分布学习导致记忆而非生成行为的局限性。

Method: 提出MESP框架，设计BL-AE和ARVM模型；提出LCH假设，验证局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但反映记忆行为；LCH验证了局部相关性的重要性。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，局部相关性对生成能力至关重要。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Method: 提出FedNCA系统，基于轻量级Med-NCA架构，支持低成本边缘设备（如智能手机）训练，并减少通信开销，同时具备加密能力。

Result: FedNCA在资源受限环境中实现了高效、轻量级且安全的医疗图像分割解决方案。

Conclusion: FedNCA为资源有限地区提供了包容性、高效且安全的医疗影像解决方案，推动了医疗公平发展。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ImplicitQA基准测试，专注于视频问答中的隐式推理能力，填补了现有方法在理解复杂叙事内容上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显式视觉内容，而忽略了需要隐式推理的复杂叙事内容（如电影、电视剧），这限制了模型对人类理解能力的模拟。

Method: 构建了ImplicitQA数据集，包含1K高质量QA对，覆盖多种隐式推理维度，如空间推理、因果关系等，并通过严格标注确保挑战性。

Result: 评估显示当前领先的视频问答模型在隐式推理任务上表现不佳，凸显其对表面视觉线索的依赖。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA为社区提供了新研究方向，推动视频问答模型向更接近人类理解能力的方向发展。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Conclusion: 该流程为青光眼早期检测提供了可重复且可扩展的方法，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Conclusion: 需进一步改进自我中心视频处理技术，通用模型在此领域显示出潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Method: 提出PrefPaint，将人类反馈直接融入Stable Diffusion Inpainting训练过程，避免计算密集型奖励模型，并开发交互式Web界面简化流程。

Result: 用户研究表明，PrefPaint在多个领域优于现有方法，减少视觉不一致性，尤其在医学图像中生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过结合人类反馈和交互式界面，显著提升了医学图像修复的准确性和用户体验。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想导致提示生成在物体边界，引发不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM引入变分提示编码器，预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将脑电活动转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Method: 采用双自注意力机制的EEG编码器，结合交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习，利用稳定扩散和变分评分蒸馏训练神经辐射场。

Result: 成功从EEG数据生成具有相似内容和结构的3D对象。

Conclusion: 该方法为从EEG数据重建3D视觉刺激提供了新思路，扩展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种RGB-IR图像对的联合压缩框架，通过跨模态熵模型（CCEM）和低频上下文提取与融合模块（LCEB和LCFB）提升压缩效率，实验显示优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RGB-IR图像对在多模态应用中的普及，数据存储和传输成本成倍增加，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包含LCEB和LCFB模块，用于提取和融合跨模态的低频上下文信息，优化熵参数预测。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上表现优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从面部视频中捕捉细微的肤色变化以估计生理信号（如心率）是rPPG的关键，但现有方法在无标签数据下表现不佳。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器（MAE）学习高维时空表示，结合帧掩码和生理带宽限制约束。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过自监督学习有效捕捉周期性信号，为rPPG任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力分数的令牌压缩方法无法有效捕捉所有语义区域，导致令牌冗余。

Method: 提出基于语义连接组件（SCC）的两步时空令牌压缩策略，将令牌分配到不同的语义区域。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC实现了高效的令牌压缩，提升了视频多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感（RS）图像理解的新型大视觉语言模型（LVLM）框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，解决了现有LVLM在RS领域适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感图像与自然图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上的显著差异，现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLM）难以直接应用于遥感场景理解。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于多级视觉特征对齐；2）语义感知专家建模，分别处理不同层次的语义表示。

Result: 在多个RS任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）中，该框架实现了跨多语义层次的一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究有效填补了通用LVLM与RS特定需求之间的差距，展示了其在遥感视觉语言理解中的能力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过有效融合长程依赖和空间细节，显著提升了光学遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中表现优异，但token剪枝会显著降低其性能，尤其是位置ID的不对齐问题。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过简单调整位置ID，无需额外训练或计算开销。

Result: 在RefCOCO验证集上，GAP将LLaVA的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复至51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP是一种高效且无需额外开销的方法，显著提升了剪枝后模型的性能，适用于多种模型和剪枝策略。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升远程评估的自动化评分鲁棒性，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Conclusion: SODA通过邻域分数传播有效解决了3D VLM在合成到真实域偏移中的性能下降问题，显著提升了OOD检测能力。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Fine Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) remains a challenging task in
computer vision due to subtle inter class differences and fragile feature
representations. Existing methods struggle in fine grained scenarios,
especially when labeled data is scarce. We propose a semi supervised method
combining Mamba based feature modeling, region attention, and Bayesian
uncertainty. Our approach enhances local to global feature modeling while
focusing on key areas during learning. Bayesian inference selects high quality
pseudo labels for stability. Experiments show strong performance on FGVC
benchmarks with occlusions, demonstrating robustness when labeled data is
limited. Code is available at https://github.com/wxqnl/RAUM Net.

Result: 模型能够生成与用户文本和属性输入一致的逼真动作，新数据集HumanAttr验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文为属性感知的文本到动作生成设定了首个基准，并通过实验验证了框架的实用性。

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SepFormer通过单步分隔符回归，显著提升了表格结构识别的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Conclusion: SPAZER通过结合空间与语义推理，无需3D标注数据即可实现鲁棒的零样本定位。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割面临类间差异、遮挡和对象尺寸变化的挑战，现有深度卷积神经网络（DCNNs）难以提取足够特征。

Method: 采用两个堆叠的编码器-解码器网络和扩张残差块（DRB），以捕获长程语义并保留空间信息。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet性能优于现有DCNNs。

Conclusion: SDRNet通过多上下文特征学习和全局-局部上下文利用，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割效果。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了点云理解的性能，尤其在语义关系捕捉和下游任务表现上。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T语义分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，难以区分视觉相似类别；SAM在实例分割中表现优异，但与热图像和文本的融合存在模态异构和计算效率问题。

Method: 采用LoRA微调技术，提出动态特征融合模块（DFFM）融合多模态视觉特征，冻结SAM的原始Transformer块；在掩码解码器中引入CLIP生成的文本嵌入以实现语义对齐。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中表现优异，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TASeg通过结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了RGB-T语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳，因此探索如何利用MLLMs改进跟踪任务。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准测试中表现突出，同时保留了原模型的大部分通用能力。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Method: 提出指数扭矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案进行正则化，有效剪除冗余和远距离模块，保留近距离和必要模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，ETP在多个领域显著提高了压缩率，且精度下降几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的剪枝方法，优于现有技术，适用于广泛的领域。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg和SGD方法解决了零样本语义分割中视觉-语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示之间的语义差距问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本语义分割需要从已见类别的监督中分割未见类别，但现有方法在视觉-语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示的语义差距上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头，以及选择性全局蒸馏（SGD）和语义对齐模块（SAM）。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，hIoU分别提高了0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了零样本语义分割中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

TL;DR: FIAG是一种新型的3D说话头合成框架，通过共享的全局高斯场和通用运动场，实现高效的身份特定适应，仅需少量训练数据即可完成。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有基于重建和渲染的说话头合成方法对身份特定模型的依赖，提高计算效率和可扩展性。

Method: 提出FIAG框架，结合全局高斯场（支持多身份共享表示）和通用运动场（捕捉跨身份的运动动态），实现快速身份适应。

Result: 实验表明，FIAG在效果和泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIAG框架通过共享结构和运动信息，显著提升了说话头合成的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Conclusion: 该框架通过直线约束和人机交互简化了操作，同时保持了临床相关性和对齐灵活性。

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新的技术和结构设计，实现了高质量的实时音频驱动肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Result: 在Fastec数据集上的实验验证了方法的可行性，适用于滚动快门SfM初始化。

Conclusion: 该方法为滚动快门SfM提供了基础模块，具有进一步开发的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Motivation: 现有远程心率测量方法通常针对10秒左右的视频片段，忽视了超短视频片段的需求，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出周期性引导的rPPG估计方法，并通过生成器重构更长的rPPG信号以减少频谱泄漏的影响。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新视角，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在MLVU、LongVideoBench和Video-MME等基准数据集上，Q-Frame优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-Frame能显著提升视频理解任务的性能，同时不超出计算限制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过增强视觉输入的低级空间结构（如水平线）并结合文本提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中存在绑定问题，即难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉输入中引入低级空间结构，并配合鼓励序列化、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 在多个视觉推理任务中取得显著改进，如GPT-4o视觉搜索准确率提升25.00%，计数准确率提升26.83%，场景描述编辑距离误差减少0.32，空间关系任务性能提升9.50%。

Conclusion: 低级视觉结构化是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中性能的有效且未被充分探索的方向，优于纯语言策略。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

TL;DR: RetFiner是一种自监督视觉语言优化方案，通过利用文本数据的丰富监督信号，提升现有基础模型的表征能力，从而在多样化的OCT分类任务中显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于OCT图像的自监督基础模型缺乏对图像的全面语义理解，导致下游任务性能不足，尤其是复杂任务，且需要监督微调。

Method: 提出RetFiner，通过多样化的训练目标利用文本数据的监督信号，优化现有基础模型的表征能力。

Result: 在七项OCT分类任务中，RetFiner显著提升了RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM的线性探测性能，平均分别提高了5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言优化方案有效提升了基础模型的适应性和下游任务性能，无需监督微调。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

TL;DR: 提出了一种Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS)框架，通过解耦特征空间解决Few-shot目标检测中类特定对象性标准和样本不具代表性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Few-shot目标检测方法在共享特征空间中耦合对象性识别和前景分类，导致类特定对象性标准和样本不具代表性。

Method: 提出UOFS框架，解耦特征空间为幅度和角度两部分，分别编码对象性和分类。采用Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO)策略解决未标记前景实例和角度优化问题，并引入SADA模块处理任务冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于耦合特征空间的方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦特征空间和优化策略，有效提升了Few-shot目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法忽视语义空间中细粒度动作模式的问题，如手部动作在相似动作中的差异。

Method: FS-VAE包含三个关键模块：频率增强、多级语义对齐和校准交叉对齐损失。

Result: 实验验证了频率增强语义特征能有效区分视觉和语义相似的动作簇，提升零样本识别性能。

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率和语义的联合优化，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角投影姿态的相互约束，显著提升了配准性能，适用于临床导航。

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE为低光图像增强提供了一种高效且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Conclusion: 量子启发的增强方法有效，但更强的酉变换虽保留信息却可能导致视觉不可识别，且不增强差分隐私。

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过增强时空推理能力，解决了预训练中的关键挑战，展现出更强的空间理解和适应性。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Conclusion: EAMamba通过创新设计有效解决了Vision Mamba的局限性，为低层视觉任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Motivation: 探究VLMs是否像人类一样依赖场景上下文进行对象识别和引用。

Method: 使用COOCO数据集，测试VLMs在不同场景-对象一致性和噪声水平下的表现。

Result: VLMs会根据场景-对象语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息，尤其在目标-场景高度一致或对象退化时更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，VisionDrop优于现有方法，无需额外训练或复杂修改，保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: VisionDrop通过简单有效的设计，实现了高效推理和性能保留，解决了跨模态不对齐问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段管道和优化策略，有效解决了3D室内场景生成的挑战，适用于多种输入模态。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新设计和优化策略，显著提升了视频外绘任务的质量和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单日期高分辨率SAR图像和多源地理空间数据的深度学习框架，用于快速检测建筑物损坏，无需依赖灾前数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学卫星图像在灾害后因云层覆盖或缺乏灾前数据而受限的问题，提供快速可靠的建筑物损坏评估。

Method: 结合SAR图像、OSM建筑足迹、DSM数据和GEM的结构与暴露属性，构建多模态深度学习框架。

Result: 在土耳其2023年地震数据集上验证，显示地理空间特征的加入显著提升了检测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能快速部署，支持灾害管理和恢复，且适用于多种受灾地区。

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Motivation: 模糊保险库生物识别系统（BCS）中存在性能差距，主要源于特征集大小不稳定和信息丢失，影响了错误纠正能力和相似性阈值。

Method: 提出了一种基于等频区间的特征量化方法，确保固定特征集大小，并支持无训练适应任意区间数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了模板保护引入的性能差距，并在人脸、指纹和虹膜识别系统中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了性能下降问题，适用于多种生物识别模态，且与现有系统兼容。

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Conclusion: 尽管研究针对地面车辆分类，但方法和结果对无人机等航空任务有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Result: GSP方法在合成和真实世界数据集上均优于现有最先进方法，并适用于少样本场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D点云OOD检测提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image
data, extending these to 3D environments involves unique obstacles. This paper
introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point
cloud OOD detection.

Motivation: 现有的视频大模型在抽象和适应性推理方面表现不足，无法根据新信息动态调整推理结果。

Method: 提出了Chain of Counterfactual Thought框架用于分类任务，结合反事实推理和ASR增强视频内容；生成任务则结合ASR输出和大型语言模型（LLM）。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法显著提升了模型的动态推理能力。

Conclusion: DVidE任务及相关框架有效增强了视频大模型的动态推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在语义等效输入下表现不一致，影响可靠性和鲁棒性，需要一种无需修改架构或大规模微调的解决方案。

Method: 提出测试时一致性框架，包括交叉熵一致性损失和伪标签一致性损失，利用单次测试输入自身信息提升一致性。

Result: 在MM-R3基准测试中显著提升模型的一致性表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Motivation: 现有方法难以确保用户意图的细粒度对齐，需要一种更精确和可控的视频编辑工具。

Result: 支持多种精确操作（如姿态编辑、纹理修改等），实验证明其优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion是高质量、可控视频编辑工作流的关键一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定框架，缺乏通用性，且需要训练。WarpRF旨在提供一种无需训练、通用的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 利用反向变形将可靠渲染投影到新视角，测量其与渲染图像的一致性。

Result: WarpRF在不确定性量化和下游任务（如主动视图选择）中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WarpRF是一种简单、低成本且通用的不确定性量化框架，适用于任何辐射场实现。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Result: 模型在视觉比较任务上训练后，能泛化到多种问题，显著提升多图像推理基准表现。

Conclusion: 自监督方法有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，无需人工标注。

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

simulator, built within the OpenAI Gym framework, incorporates realistic

defensive mechanisms. Additionally, we provide a formal simulation-based
game-theoretic model of cyberdefense using this simulator, which features a
novel approach to modeling zero-days exploits, and a PSRO-style approach for
approximately computing equilibria in this game. We use our simulator and
associated game-theoretic framework to analyze the Volt Typhoon advanced
persistent threat (APT). Volt Typhoon represents a sophisticated cyber attack
strategy employed by state-sponsored actors, characterized by stealthy,
prolonged infiltration and exploitation of network vulnerabilities. Our
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of game-theoretic strategies in
understanding network resilience against APTs and zero-days, such as Volt
Typhoon, providing valuable insight into optimal defensive posture and

Conclusion: 结论指出，此类攻击可能导致数据质量下降和开发成本增加，防御措施可能被适应性攻击者规避，形成猫鼠游戏。

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

Conclusion: 视频监控可能导致3D打印指令泄露，需加强安全防护。

Abstract: The 3D printing industry is rapidly growing and increasingly adopted across
various sectors including manufacturing, healthcare, and defense. However, the
operational setup often involves hazardous environments, necessitating remote
monitoring through cameras and other sensors, which opens the door to
cyber-based attacks. In this paper, we show that an adversary with access to
video recordings of the 3D printing process can reverse engineer the underlying
3D print instructions. Our model tracks the printer nozzle movements during the
printing process and maps the corresponding trajectory into G-code
instructions. Further, it identifies the correct parameters such as feed rate
and extrusion rate, enabling successful intellectual property theft. To
validate this, we design an equivalence checker that quantitatively compares
two sets of 3D print instructions, evaluating their similarity in producing
objects alike in shape, external appearance, and internal structure. Unlike
simple distance-based metrics such as normalized mean square error, our
equivalence checker is both rotationally and translationally invariant,
accounting for shifts in the base position of the reverse engineered
instructions caused by different camera positions. Our model achieves an
average accuracy of 90.87 percent and generates 30.20 percent fewer
instructions compared to existing methods, which often produce faulty or
inaccurate prints. Finally, we demonstrate a fully functional counterfeit
object generated by reverse engineering 3D print instructions from video.

Method: 对543家注册数据经纪商手动提交数据访问请求，并分析其回应情况。

Result: 超过40%的经纪商未回应请求，违反CCPA；回应者要求额外个人信息，增加隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需加强执法、明确指南并标准化合规检查，以提升消费者隐私保护和经纪商问责制。

Abstract: Data brokers collect and sell the personal information of millions of
individuals, often without their knowledge or consent. The California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) grants consumers the legal right to request access to, or
deletion of, their data. To facilitate these requests, California maintains an
official registry of data brokers. However, the extent to which these entities
comply with the law is unclear.
  This paper presents the first large-scale, systematic study of CCPA
compliance of all 543 officially registered data brokers. Data access requests
were manually submitted to each broker, followed by in-depth analyses of their
responses (or lack thereof). Above 40% failed to respond at all, in an apparent
violation of the CCPA. Data brokers that responded requested personal
information as part of their identity verification process, including details
they had not previously collected. Paradoxically, this means that exercising
one's privacy rights under CCPA introduces new privacy risks.
  Our findings reveal rampant non-compliance and lack of standardization of the
data access request process. These issues highlight an urgent need for stronger
enforcement, clearer guidelines, and standardized, periodic compliance checks
to enhance consumers' privacy protections and improve data broker
accountability.

Abstract: The industrial market continuously needs reliable solutions to secure

contracts designed to meet contractual conditions, avoid malicious errors,
secure exchanges, and minimize the need for reliable intermediaries. However,
smart contracts are immutable. Moreover, there are different smart contract
execution architectures (namely Order-Execute and Execute-Order-Validate) that
have different throughputs. In this study, we developed an evaluation model for
assessing the security of reliable smart contract execution. We then developed
a realistic smart contract enabled IoT energy case study. Finally, we simulate
the developed case study to evaluate several smart contract security
vulnerabilities reported in the literature. Our results show that the
Execute-Order-Validate architecture is more promising regarding reliability and

Method: 使用钓鱼邮件诱骗用户执行恶意MSI文件，通过DLL侧加载技术绕过安全措施，部署BlotchyQuasar恶意软件。

Result: 恶意软件窃取浏览器凭证和银行信息，通过键盘记录和C2服务器外传数据，但因开发仓促存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 该活动展示了高度复杂的攻击机制，对目标地区构成严重威胁，需加强网络安全防御。

Abstract: A sophisticated malspam campaign was recently uncovered targeting Latin
American countries, with a particular focus on Brazil. This operation utilizes
a highly deceptive phishing email to trick users into executing a malicious MSI
file, initiating a multi-stage infection. The core of the attack leverages DLL
side-loading, where a legitimate executable from Valve Corporation is used to
load a trojanized DLL, thereby bypassing standard security defenses.
  Once active, the malware, a variant of QuasarRAT known as BlotchyQuasar, is
capable of a wide range of malicious activities. It is designed to steal
sensitive browser-stored credentials and banking information, the latter
through fake login windows mimicking well-known Brazilian banks. The threat
establishes persistence by modifying the Windows registry , captures user

### [194] [APO: Enhancing Reasoning Ability of MLLMs via Asymmetric Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21655)
*Minjie Hong,Zirun Guo,Yan Xia,Zehan Wang,Ziang Zhang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出APO方法，结合DADS和STCR技术，解决了MLLMs在强化学习训练中的KL惩罚和过度思考问题，显著提升了推理能力且不影响通用任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在多模态数据整合中表现出色，但在复杂推理上存在困难，且RL训练常导致性能下降或过度思考。

Method: 提出APO方法，将样本分为正负两组：正样本用DADS动态调整KL权重，负样本用STCR惩罚过长响应。

Result: View-R1-3B模型在推理任务上平均提升7%，优于更大规模的MLLMs，且通用任务表现稳定。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，同时保持了泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Result: 数值实验表明算法在表格域中快速可靠地收敛到最优风险厌恶值函数。

Conclusion: 该算法为风险厌恶MDP提供了一种无需完整模型的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密度聚类方法在高维大数据中参数调优计算成本高的问题。

Result: 在NLP、音频和计算机视觉任务中验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅改进了密度聚类的参数控制，还深化了对参数关系的理解。

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态控制质量-复杂度权衡的方法，通过调整时间步长和神经网络长度，实现了高效的采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在采样时需要多次迭代求解ODE，计算复杂度高，本文探索了动态调整时间步长和网络长度的方法以提升效率。

Method: 通过重连Transformer架构中的块来求解内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现任意时间步长和块数的采样。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上的实验显示，最高效采样模式下延迟减少3倍，高质量采样时FID分数提升3.5分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间和长度维度上均具有灵活性，显著降低了延迟和内存使用，同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文本到文本回归的通用方法，用于预测复杂系统数据（如配置文件和日志）的指标结果，相比传统表格回归方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格回归方法在处理复杂系统数据（如配置文件和日志）时效果不佳，因为特征工程难以实现。因此，需要一种更通用且可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 采用文本到文本回归方法，使用一个6000万参数的编码器-解码器模型，从随机初始化开始训练。

Result: 在Google的Borg集群调度系统中，模型实现了接近完美的0.99（平均0.9）等级相关性，均方误差比表格方法低100倍，并能轻松适应新任务（仅需500个少样本示例）。

Conclusion: 文本到文本回归方法在复杂系统数据预测中表现优异，为构建通用模拟器提供了可能。

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRT需要集中所有原始数据，可能导致隐私问题；联邦学习提供隐私保护和分布式计算能力。

Method: 提出FedIRT框架，结合联邦学习与IRT，支持分布式估计，并开发了开源R包实现2PL和PCM模型。

Result: 数值实验表明FedIRT在统计准确性上与标准IRT相当，同时提供隐私保护和降低通信成本。

Conclusion: FedIRT扩展了IRT在分布式场景（如多校评估）中的应用，兼具准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

*Pritam Dash,Ethan Chan,Nathan P. Lawrence,Karthik Pattabiraman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种基于强化学习的攻击弹性控制器，通过两阶段训练框架学习鲁棒状态表示，提升无人机在传感器攻击下的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传感器易受物理攻击（如GPS欺骗），传统安全强化学习方法对此无效，需要一种更鲁棒的控制方法。

Method: ARMOR采用两阶段训练：1）教师编码器利用特权攻击信息生成攻击感知的潜在状态；2）学生编码器通过监督学习近似教师编码器，仅使用历史传感器数据。

Result: 实验表明，ARMOR优于传统方法，确保无人机安全，并能泛化到未见攻击，同时降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ARMOR为无人机在对抗性环境中的安全操作提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度的神经可塑性适应方法，同时优化神经模糊网络的参数和结构，解决了现有方法中参数与结构分离优化的问题，并在视觉任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经模糊网络（NFNs）具有透明性和符号性，但其系统化设计过程仍具挑战性，现有方法通常分离参数和结构优化，导致架构脆弱。

Method: 提出梯度基神经可塑性适应方法，同时优化NFNs的参数和结构，适用于在线强化学习等复杂任务。

Result: 实验证明该方法在视觉任务（如DOOM游戏）中表现优异。

Conclusion: 同时优化参数和结构的方法显著提升了NFNs的性能，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

TL;DR: M3PO是一种基于模型的强化学习框架，通过结合隐式世界模型和混合探索策略，解决了单任务样本效率低和多任务泛化差的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的方法（如DreamerV3）忽略了控制中心表示，而基于模型的方法（如PPO）样本复杂度高且探索能力弱。M3PO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: M3PO整合了隐式世界模型（预测任务结果而非观测重建）和混合探索策略（结合基于模型的规划和基于模型的不确定性驱动奖励），并通过信任区域优化器稳定策略更新。

Result: M3PO在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提供了高效且稳健的替代方案。

Conclusion: M3PO通过消除偏差-方差权衡，显著提升了强化学习在单任务和多任务中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Result: 在超过2400万个结构的数据集上训练，并在三种异构超级计算机上验证了高效扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法在化学领域的大规模数据集和异构计算架构上表现出良好的通用性和扩展潜力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，解释离散符号结构如何从连续的神经网络训练动态中自然涌现。通过将神经参数提升到测度空间并建模训练为Wasserstein梯度流，揭示了在几何约束下参数测度的两种现象：梯度流解耦和自由度收缩。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是理解连续神经网络如何自然地形成离散符号结构，为神经符号系统的设计和理解提供理论基础。

Method: 方法包括将神经参数提升到测度空间，建模训练为Wasserstein梯度流，并分析在几何约束下的参数测度动态。

Result: 结果表明，训练过程中网络从高维探索过渡到符合代数操作的组合表示，自由度降低，并建立了实现符号任务的数据缩放定律。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为理解神经符号系统提供了理论基础，整合了连续学习与离散代数推理。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Result: BP结合检查点技术在准确性、收敛速度和计算效率上显著优于FmAD和ZO，尤其是在大模型中。

Conclusion: BP结合检查点技术是内存受限环境下最有效的模型训练策略，FmAD和ZO存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides
practical insights into future directions.

Result: 实验表明，TOAST在低信噪比条件下显著优于基线方法，同时保持所有测试场景下的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: TOAST为6G语义通信提供了一个高效、适应性强的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: We propose HQCM-EBTC, a hybrid quantum-classical model for automated brain
tumor classification using MRI images. Trained on a dataset of 7,576 scans
covering normal, meningioma, glioma, and pituitary classes, HQCM-EBTC
integrates a 5-qubit, depth-2 quantum layer with 5 parallel circuits, optimized

imaging, advancing both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability for clinical
brain tumor assessment.

Motivation: 变分量子算法（VQAs）在近期量子优势中具有潜力，但面临梯度消失（barren plateaus）和优化条件差的问题。

Method: 引入GuiderNet，一个经典神经网络框架，通过最小化Fubini-Study度量张量的对数条件数，指导量子电路参数的几何优化。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum
advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and
poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also
suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling
smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric
meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing
a scalable approach to enhance trainability and generalization in quantum
machine learning.

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Conclusion: R* DT通过逐步优化RTG值和数据增强，显著提升了自动竞价系统的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Conclusion: 该模型为图时间序列任务提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，结合了理论可解释性和深度学习优势。

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，奖励函数并非总是可用，尤其在视频游戏开发等应用场景中。

Method: 提出TROFI方法，通过人类偏好学习奖励函数，标注数据集后训练策略，无需最优轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优于基线方法，接近使用真实奖励函数的效果，并在3D游戏环境中验证。

Conclusion: 奖励函数的设计对值函数与实际未来折扣奖励的对齐至关重要。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Motivation: 现有TSFMs主要针对实值序列设计，难以处理包含异构协变量（如分类变量、多模态数据）的通用预测任务。

Result: 在单模态和多模态协变量预测基准测试中，UniCA表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UniCA为协变量感知的TSFM适应提供了通用解决方案，展现了在实际预测场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但存在激活方差指数增长的问题，导致残差路径主导子层输出，限制了深层的学习能力。

Method: 提出了Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS)，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，保留激活信息并避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B的不同规模模型上实验，GPAS均取得了性能提升，并适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，能够改善Pre-LN Transformer及其他架构的训练动态，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and
macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE)
demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone

potential of hybrid architectures in financial forecasting and provides
insights into model adaptability across different cryptocurrencies and market

Conclusion: Transformer是当前硬件条件下高效的GNN实现，展现了其在表达学习中的优势。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络方法在多目标多图路径规划中具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

### [225] [Earthquake Damage Grades Prediction using An Ensemble Approach Integrating Advanced Machine and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22129)

Result: 研究揭示了影响地震脆弱性的关键因素，并验证了SMOTE和多种模型在提升预测效果上的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过优化模型和解决类别不平衡，该研究为地震后建筑损坏预测提供了更准确的方法，有助于改进救援资源分配。

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了Thompson采样的适用范围，适用于更一般的控制空间，且具有理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Motivation: 探索LLM和智能体系统在药物发现中的模块化潜力，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 比较不同LLM（如Claude、GPT-4o、Llama等）和代理类型（工具调用与代码生成）的性能，使用LLM-as-a-judge评分。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4o表现优于其他模型；代码生成代理整体更优，但结果因问题和模型而异。

Conclusion: 模块化需结合提示重新设计，未来需进一步研究以实现稳定、可扩展的智能体系统。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework
that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon
Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless
compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of
representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts
storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements
enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning,
and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this
data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep

as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural
architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty,
there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of
various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.
  In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for
evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of
over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside
key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior
performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping
performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural
properties.

Conclusion: EFRame为强化学习提供了更精细的样本分类和分析方法，显著提升了GRPO的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: 投影压缩是一种高效且性能优越的模型压缩方法。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统狄拉克δ假设的限制，能够学习更灵活的结构和分布，适用于广泛的张量分析任务。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，CoATA优于十一种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: CoATA有效捕捉了拓扑与属性之间的协同关系，提升了GNN在噪声和不完整图上的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

Conclusion: Koopman增强的流匹配结合了采样效率和解析结构，为快速且可解释的生成建模提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Result: 实验显示，LGES比GES快10倍，结构错误更少，且在样本极限下能恢复真实的等价类。

Conclusion: LGES在速度、准确性和鲁棒性上优于GES及其他基线方法。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic
distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature
representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal
dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a
novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate
temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features.
Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical
datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and
electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the
robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework
offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

Conclusion: CLoVE在聚类联邦学习中表现优异，适用于多种任务，具有简单、鲁棒和高效的特点。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.
