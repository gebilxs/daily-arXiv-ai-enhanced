In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning\nattacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for\nDMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for\nvisualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we\nobserve that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept\nregions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism\ncomprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency\npoison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid\nadversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain\nlearning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning\nmethods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all\npoisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published\ndefenses.

An evaluative challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions\ncompared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and\nexamine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a\nmethodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a\nsignificant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to\nconsist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between\nspontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these\ndatasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be\ndeployed in in-the-wild applications.

During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with\ntheoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight\nthe need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

Moreover, rapid detection of\nattacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent\nlarge-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time\nintrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning\nframework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages\nabundant unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and attack behaviors\neffectively. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15,\nBoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20 percent, 1.28 percent, and 8 percent\nof labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions.\nExperimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive\nlearning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection\naccuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model\ncomplex relationships and its learnable activation functions are also explored\nand visualized, offering interpretability and potential for rule extraction.\nThe method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in\nsafety-critical environments where reliability is paramount.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7b2c\u56db\u6b21\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548cKAN\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728UNSW-NB15\u3001BoT-IoT\u548cGas Pipeline\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14KAN\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "KAN\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups\nwith nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster\nstructure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.\nFinally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information\nacross multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node\nrepresentations.

Adult service\nwebsites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a\nplatform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware.

However, label noise, which\narises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training\ninstability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with\nnoise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate\nFedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical\ndatasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,\nextreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise\nscenarios.

However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness.

In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images.

Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome.

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep\nlearning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective\nplayer and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.\nHowever, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of\ninteractions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling\nmatch dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous\nInteraction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep\nlearning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a\nmulti-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player\ndynamics and high-level team interactions.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes\nother images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.\nHowever, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we\napply text information to \\textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we\nfurther explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local\n\\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection\ntasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits\nsuperior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on\nanomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,\ne.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by\n+4.6\\%$\\uparrow$/+5.7\\%$\\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.", "AI": {"tldr": "FiSeCLIP\u5229\u7528CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CLIP\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590dCLIP\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFiSeCLIP\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FiSeCLIP\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt.

The model is also lightweight with\na small memory footprint of $144.09$\\,MB of RAM usage.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

Collecting accurate\nsurface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is\ninherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.\nThus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of\nhigh-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.\nDifferent from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or\nlower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of\nthe ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset\nis designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of\nstate-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and\nmulti-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the\nchallenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D\nhas significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment\nfoot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,\nprosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of\nthe foot during motion.

However, its inherent reliance on paired\nimage-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance\", presents two\nfundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired\nreports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for\ntraining; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with\npaired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where\nsegmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we\npropose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for\nlanguage-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At\nits core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic\nApproximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from\ntextual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by\ndistilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once\ninitialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates\nsemantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual\nreliance.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoMaP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u90e83D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-GALP\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548cSDS\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-GALP\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5305\u62ecL1\u951a\u5b9a\u635f\u5931\u548c\u989d\u5916\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRoMaP\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RoMaP\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Providing infrastructure for\ngenerative reasoning with such models requires a high effort, due to a wide\nrange of different denoising formulations, samplers, and inference strategies.\nOur presented framework aims to facilitate research in this area, providing\neasy-to-use interfaces to control variable mapping from arbitrary data domains,\ngenerative model paradigms, and inference strategies.

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method.

However, these\nmodels often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as\nthe precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In\nthis paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that\nspecifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the\nintegration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By\nunifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself\nas an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration.

Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20\nproducts), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+\noptimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within\nseconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and\nefficiency.

This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy.

Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct\nevaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.\nThis paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in\nthe context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset\ncontaining 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.\nWe evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and\nperformance on PMG. \\textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across\nsix PMo criteria, whereas \\textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in\nterms of process element similarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\uff08PMRs\uff09\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff08PMo\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PMo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cMermaid\u5728PMo\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cBPMN text\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PMRs\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0cPMG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaPMo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b55\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ca\u4e5d\u79cdPMRs\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4eceLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684PMo\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548cPMG\u6027\u80fd\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30PMRs\u3002", "result": "Mermaid\u5728\u516d\u9879PMo\u6807\u51c6\u4e2d\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cBPMN text\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aPMRs\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0cMermaid\u548cBPMN text\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space.

Accurate disease\ndetection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing\ntargeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,\nparticularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially\ndecreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of\ndetection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on\nmassive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising\nperformance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids\nand a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a\nnovel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation\nlearning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages\nover existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;\n(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus\ndiseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning.

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency.

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long\nvideo generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to\naccurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model.

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation.

Existing similarity metrics often lack precision\nin identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits\ntheir applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived\ndirectly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand\nsides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws\ninspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in\nweight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach\nnaturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an\nexact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,\nusing the StrIPLIB dataset.

However, this dependence exposes them to\nsophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to\ndeceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly\nperturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without\ntriggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional\ndistributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a\nthreshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and\ntimely response.

Furthermore, backpropagating error\nsignals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding\ngradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a\nnovel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals\nduring the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,\nlayer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from\nmulti-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance.

While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust.

To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708).

Wendland RBFs,\nknown for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in\napproximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional\nactivation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced\nWendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and\nexponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation,\nand enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its\nmathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical\nexperiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results\nshow that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain\nscenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational\nefficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning,\nsuggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve\ngeneralization through localized, smooth transformations.

In this\nwork, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where\nthe time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin\nequation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,\ndamping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent\nboth autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the\npotential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled\noscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors\nobserved in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent\nencoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent\nspace. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on\nsynthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching\nground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model\nachieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward\nprediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or\nsurpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand\nvelocity.
