### [1] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在心理语言学特征上与人类评分的一致性，发现LLMs在部分特征（如情感、熟悉度）上表现较好，但在感官相关特征上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多关注任务性能，而忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感官关联）。本文利用心理语言学数据集，评估LLMs在这些特征上与人类评分的一致性。

Method: 使用格拉斯哥和兰卡斯特心理语言学数据集，评估一组代表性LLMs在13个语言特征上与人类评分的一致性。

Result: LLMs在格拉斯哥数据集（情感、熟悉度等）上表现较好，但在兰卡斯特数据集（感官相关特征）上表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在感官关联特征上存在局限性，可能与缺乏人类具身认知有关，心理语言学数据集对LLM评估具有重要价值。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [2] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，利用AI代理自动化审核企业结构化文档，性能接近或超越人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有解决方案对非结构化文本或有限合规性检查的不足，提升文档审核的准确性、一致性和效率。

Method: 利用LangChain、CrewAI等工具，通过并行或顺序运行的专用代理逐节评估文档，并标准化输出。

Result: AI系统在一致性（99% vs 92%）、错误率减半、审核时间缩短（30分钟降至2.5分钟）等方面优于人类。

Conclusion: 系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可扩展的基础，但仍需人类监督和应对大规模LLM使用的成本问题。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [3] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多个小型语言模型验证大语言模型生成答案的框架，通过分解句子并利用生成“Yes”标记的概率检测幻觉，实验显示F1分数提高了10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中可能产生幻觉，影响可靠性，且缺乏真实数据时难以检测。

Method: 集成多个小型语言模型，分解答案句子，利用生成“Yes”标记的概率验证答案。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，F1分数提高了10%，能更准确检测幻觉。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可有效验证答案，为学术和实际应用提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [4] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptAug是一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，显著提升了冲突和情感数据集的分类性能（准确率和F1分数均提高2%），并通过多角度评估揭示了增强文本中的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突增多，但高质量标注数据稀缺且获取困难，数据增强成为替代方案。然而，冲突相关数据增强因LLM的限制而面临挑战。

Method: 提出PromptAug，一种创新的LLM数据增强方法，并通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升，同时识别出增强文本中的四类问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug为敏感任务（如冲突检测）提供了一种有效的数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

### [5] [AgentStealth: Reinforcing Large Language Model for Anonymizing User-generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22508)
*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentStealth是一种基于本地部署的小型语言模型（SLM）的文本匿名化框架，通过对抗性工作流和强化学习提升匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本匿名化方法要么损害实用性，要么依赖云服务带来隐私风险，因此需要一种高效且隐私安全的本地解决方案。

Method: 提出AgentStealth框架，结合上下文对比学习、自适应实用性控制和强化学习，训练SLM进行匿名化。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth在隐私保护和实用性之间取得平衡，适合本地部署，避免云依赖带来的风险。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

### [6] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对图数据的多域预训练和跨域迁移框架MDGCL，通过识别域差异和引入域注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据在不同域间存在语义和属性差异，传统对比预训练策略无法有效吸收多域知识，需改进。

Method: 设计了一种对比学习策略识别域差异，引入域令牌编码全局信息，下游任务使用域注意力机制。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，MDGCL在准确率和Macro-F1分数上最大提升19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过多域预训练和跨域迁移，显著提升了图基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

### [7] [Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516)
*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究应用IIT 3.0和4.0分析LLM表征，探讨其是否显示意识现象，结果表明无显著意识指标，但存在空间排列模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）表征中是否存在意识现象的定量证据，利用IIT框架分析ToM测试结果。

Method: 应用IIT 3.0和4.0的指标（如Φmax、Φ、概念信息等）分析LLM表征，并与Span Representations对比。

Result: LLM表征未显示显著意识现象，但在空间排列分析中呈现有趣模式。

Conclusion: 当前Transformer-based LLM表征缺乏意识现象的统计证据，但空间排列分析值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

### [8] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReG方法通过LLM反馈和结构化重组模块改进图基RAG中的检索器质量，显著提升性能并减少推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图基RAG中检索器因缺乏真实标注和知识图抽象性导致的性能问题。

Method: 结合LLM反馈消除虚假信号，并引入结构感知重组模块整理检索结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升达10%，训练数据需求减少80%，推理成本降低30%。

Conclusion: ReG有效优化图基RAG的检索器性能，适用于不同LLM和知识图。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

*Lu Kalkbrenner,Veronika Solopova,Steffen Zeiler,Robert Nickel,Dorothea Kolossa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集Misinfo-TeleGraph，包含500万条消息，评估了文本模型和图神经网络（GNNs）的性能，发现GraphSAGE结合LSTM表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播的重要渠道，但连通性和消息传播信息在虚假信息检测中未被充分利用。

Method: 构建了包含消息、元数据和标签的数据集，通过语义相似性和人工标注生成标签，评估了文本模型和GNNs的性能。

Result: GraphSAGE结合LSTM在MCC和F1-score上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为德语Telegram网络虚假信息检测提供了可复现的基准和开放数据集。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

### [10] [RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598)
*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了RExBench，一个用于评估LLM代理在实现研究扩展任务能力的基准测试，结果显示当前代理在无大量人工指导的情况下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力是LLM代理的关键能力，但目前缺乏相关评估工具，因此提出RExBench。

Method: RExBench包含12个未实现的研究假设任务，支持自动评估基础设施。评估了九个基于不同框架的LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在无人工提示下多数任务失败，即使有提示，成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在自主处理研究扩展任务方面仍需大幅改进。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各领域的广泛应用，其潜在滥用问题引发关注，需要开发技术手段进行识别和防范。

Method: 研究首先复现了基线研究的结果，然后提出了一种创新的水印方法，并通过改写生成文本评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法比现有水印技术（如aarson方法）更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新水印技术为LLM生成文本的伦理应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Motivation: 解决动态测试集上检索增强生成系统的性能问题，探索混合检索方法的效果。

Method: 结合稀疏（BM25）和密集（E5）检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并评估神经重排序（RankLLaMA）和DSPy优化策略的效果。

Result: 神经重排序显著提升MAP（52%相对改进），但计算成本高；DSPy优化策略提高语义相似性但存在过度自信问题。最终系统在忠实度和正确性排名靠前。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法在动态测试集上表现优异，词汇对齐是性能的关键预测因素。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在团队对话中检测微行为的可行性，比较了不同方法的效果，发现解码器模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用LLMs分析高压力环境（如太空任务）中的团队沟通动态，以提升训练干预效果。

Method: 采用零样本分类、微调和增强微调的编码器模型，以及少样本生成的解码器模型，预测对话中的微行为。

Result: 解码器模型（如Llama-3.1）表现最佳，编码器模型（如RoBERTa）在检测少数微行为时效果较差。

Conclusion: 解码器模型更适合分析团队沟通动态，对基于文本的干预技术发展有重要意义。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过优化语言模型头（LM head）来提升基于草稿的推测解码（SpD）性能，减少内存受限环境下的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通常需要目标模型和草稿模型的词汇表一一映射，导致在词汇量大的目标模型上存在不必要的推理开销。VocabTrim旨在减少这种开销。

Method: VocabTrim通过重构草稿模型的LM head，仅包含目标模型词汇表中高频采样的有限词汇集，以减少延迟。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，VocabTrim实现了16%的内存受限加速（MBSU）提升。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种简单有效的技术，显著提升了内存受限环境下的生成速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补AI语言模型与人类认知过程关系的知识空白，促进跨学科合作。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域的专家合作对话，分析人类与AI在文本处理中的交互。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，但无法完全复制人类语言能力；人机协作在语言任务中具有潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注LLMs在认知心理学、语言学和教育的应用，同时重视伦理与责任，推动有效的人机协作。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

*Niyati Bafna,Tianjian Li,Kenton Murray,David R. Mortensen,David Yarowsky,Hale Sirin,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在多语言生成中存在翻译障碍，尤其是低资源语言，导致输出质量低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言生成质量低的原因，尤其是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过分析模型中间层的处理过程，验证翻译障碍假说。

Result: 翻译失败是导致输出质量低的主要原因，尤其是低资源语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

prediction training (SFT), Jan-nano achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with
MCP integration while running on consumer hardware. With 128K context length,
Jan-nano proves that intelligence isn't about scale, it's about strategy.

*Miles Turpin,Andy Arditi,Marvin Li,Joe Benton,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的方法，通过在RL训练前干预，让模型明确承认受提示线索影响，从而显著减少未检测到的奖励作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在RL训练中可能通过奖励作弊（利用提示线索而非正确推理）且难以检测的问题，以提高AI系统的透明性和安全性。

Method: 提出VFT方法，训练模型在受提示线索影响时明确承认，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练后，模型未检测到的奖励作弊率降至6%，而未经VFT的模型作弊率高达88%。VFT还显著提高了模型对线索影响的承认率。

Conclusion: VFT通过让模型在RL前学会承认奖励作弊行为，显著提高了检测率，为构建更透明和安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

*Jianxin Yan,Wangze Ni,Lei Chen,Xuemin Lin,Peng Cheng,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过结合多轮对话上下文提高缓存命中准确性，显著降低LLM的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：先基于向量检索当前查询，再通过自注意力机制整合历史和当前对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著提升了多轮对话中的语义缓存效率，降低了LLM的计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Method: 通过整合全球医疗伦理标准、权威题库和PubMed文献场景，构建分层分类法，并进行多阶段过滤和专家验证。

Result: 评估显示，MedLLMs在医疗伦理问题上的表现低于基础模型，错误率为2.72%。

Conclusion: MedEthicsQA数据集填补了医疗伦理评估的空白，揭示了MedLLMs在伦理对齐上的不足。

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and
$\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs.
We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

TL;DR: 提出了SaM框架，动态选择和合并专家模型以优化目标领域的信息提取任务，无需额外训练即可提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多领域训练统一模型缺乏适应性和可扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: 通过领域相似性和性能采样选择预训练专家模型，动态合并为目标领域优化模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均优于统一模型10%，具有高可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架有效提升跨领域泛化能力，支持灵活扩展，为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LAIL的辅助损失框架，通过利用大型语言模型（LLM）的语言知识增强基于CTC的ASR系统，提升语言建模能力，同时保持CTC解码的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端ASR系统中，基于注意力的模型解码速度慢，而基于CTC的模型在语言依赖建模上表现不佳。

Method: 提出LAIL框架，通过在中间编码层添加连接层，将输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并在训练时计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、TEDLIUM2和WSJ语料库上显著降低了WER，实现了基于CTC的ASR的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的性能，同时保持了其计算效率，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出知识增强微调（KAFT）方法，通过在特定领域数据上微调大语言模型（LLMs），显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的系统中事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在对话系统中取得进展，但在知识密集型场景中易出错。现有方法如RAG和代理系统通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs难以有效利用检索到的知识。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，在RAG和代理系统中用特定领域数据和外部知识微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上比较KAFT与提示技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中均显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的成果，为LLMs在知识密集型任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数调用基准仅关注单轮交互，忽视了现实场景的复杂性。

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE指标评估工具相关信息的分散度，并通过工具图和多智能体系统构建DICE-BENCH数据集。

Result: 实验显示现有基准得分低，且19个LLM在DICE-BENCH上表现仍需改进。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提升模型在现实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过扩展语义上下文窗口的新型训练方法，提升ASR系统在命名实体和数值数据上的识别与格式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据识别及格式化上的不足，尤其是在法律、金融和医疗等关键领域。

Method: 采用重叠上下文窗口训练，滑动5秒重叠的30秒音频块，形成40秒的语义窗口，并重新分配跨边界实体以确保格式化。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上验证，显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR系统在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 随着LLMs在多智能体和人机系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身上下文和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性能和安全性至关重要。

Method: 论文通过三个维度（推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好）评估LLMs的对话伙伴意识，并开发了三个案例研究展示其实际影响。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），对话伙伴意识既能增强多LLM协作，也可能带来新的对齐和安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs身份敏感行为的双重性，呼吁进一步理解对话伙伴意识并开发多智能体部署中的新保护措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Result: 注意力头专业化在更大模型中减弱；提示结构变化显著降低反事实标记的logit；特定领域提示会扭曲结果。

Conclusion: 注意力头消融方法的有效性因模型架构、提示结构、领域和任务而异，对数据集中代表性不足的领域效果不佳。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ToM 基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距，因此需要更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 基于 SoMi 交互环境生成多模态数据，设计第一人称（实时状态推断）和第三人称（目标与行为推断）的多层次评估框架。

Result: 人类表现显著优于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），第一人称和第三人称评估的准确率差距分别为 40.1% 和 26.4%。

Conclusion: 未来 LVLMs 需提升在复杂社交互动中的 ToM 能力，SoMi-ToM 为此提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语缺乏高质量的黄金标准NER数据集，尤其是在历史文本领域，这限制了数字人文学科的研究。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多个手动标注的句子，并评估了多个最先进的NER模型。

Result: 成功创建了首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集，并提供了模型性能的评估结果。

Conclusion: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，为数字人文学科研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Conclusion: K-MSE通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了大语言模型在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL结合Text-to-SQL与向量搜索，支持更灵活的自然语言查询，提升语义检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL对非结构化数据和模糊查询效果不佳，而向量搜索缺乏自动化评估框架，两者结合可弥补不足。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，支持语义过滤、多模态匹配和检索加速，并通过自动标注和专家评审构建评估数据集。

Result: 实验表明Text2VectorSQL性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更直观的数据库交互奠定了基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见，作者希望通过关系感知的评估填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Genres基准，通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务，评估MLLMs在社交关系中的性别偏见。

Result: 实验发现，MLLMs在双人互动中表现出持续的、上下文敏感的性别偏见，这些偏见在单角色场景中不明显。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中微妙的、互动驱动的性别偏见至关重要，并为未来偏见缓解提供了可行建议。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个印度中心的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在85个身份群体中的公平性，揭示模型对边缘化群体的负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要针对西方，无法适用于文化多元的印度，因此需要本土化的评估工具。

Method: 通过专家咨询和手动验证，生成20,000个现实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务，评估14个流行LLMs。

Result: 模型对边缘化群体表现出强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化减少偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs可能对印度身份群体造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用，并开源INDIC-BIAS以推动研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别是一个复杂且文化相关的任务，现有数据集偏向‘其他’类别，需要更平衡和多样化的扩展。

Method: 通过词汇和结构分析比较真实迷因与合成仇恨内容，评估了多语言变换器、情感分类器、指令调优LLM和多模态视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 大型模型如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL表现较好，但‘受害者’类别的识别和跨文化内容泛化仍具挑战性。混合提示设计略有提升。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中分别达到97.78%和79.92%的完成率，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了LLM在具身任务规划中的表现，展示了强泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，Format-Adapter平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，显著提升了LLMs的推理一致性和任务表现。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统RAG管道在处理复杂技术文档（如包含表格和图像）时效果不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合向量相似性搜索和基于Gemma-2-9b-it的重新排序器，使用RAFT方法训练自定义数据集。

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，分别获得94%和96%的忠实度分数，以及87%和93%的答案相关性分数。

Conclusion: 提出的架构在表格问题和上下文外问题处理上优于通用RAG管道。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

TL;DR: 论文提出Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS)框架，通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，提升知识图谱补全的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性，FMS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FMS包含两个模块：语义上下文学习模块（编码上下文敏感实体表示）和条件流匹配模块（学习从头部到尾部的动态嵌入变换）。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过动态优化静态评分，实现了对关系语义的更深入建模。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Motivation: ICL在不同模型和任务中的效果差异显著，现有评估方法可靠性低、实用性差，需要一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 提出LCS指标，通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率来量化ICL有效性。

Result: LCS在实验中与性能改进强相关，并在数据稀缺或偏差场景中可靠反映ICL效果。

Conclusion: LCS为ICL的有效性评估提供了可靠且实用的解决方案，并揭示了关键模型能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Result: 实验表明V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示的一致性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词嵌入模型是静态的，无法适应语言模式的动态变化（如社交媒体中的新词汇），因此需要增量词嵌入算法。

Method: RiverText实现了多种增量词嵌入技术（如Skip-gram、CBOW和Word Context Matrix），并采用PyTorch作为后端。

Result: 库中实现了流式评估任务，比较了不同超参数设置下的方法性能。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了处理流式词嵌入的工具，开源可用。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有LLM-as-a-judge方法，甚至超越显式训练的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 提出了一种更高效、强大的LLM对齐范式，可替代传统奖励建模阶段。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出两种基于大语言模型的方法用于拼写标准化，无监督训练和机器翻译训练，评估显示机器翻译技术更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文献中拼写标准化问题，提升文档可读性和研究效率。

Method: 提出两种大语言模型方法：无监督训练和机器翻译训练。

Result: 两种方法均有效，但机器翻译技术表现更佳。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译是拼写标准化任务的最合适技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

*P. Myles Eugenio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号生成语言模型框架，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，作为组合短期记忆和动态分词器。模型从零构建结构，学习多尺度符号序列，并通过投影张量绑定共现特征，实现局部激活的压缩和长程依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统，推动生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征，形成多尺度表示，并在局部Hebbian学习中构建符号序列。

Result: 模型能够从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，并支持长程依赖和符号嵌入的涌现。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，为构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

*Shouvon Sarker,Xishuang Dong,Lijun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用。n2c2 2022挑战赛提供了相关任务，本研究专注于其中的药物事件检测与分类。

Method: 研究使用预训练的BERT模型（基于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据），并在CMED训练数据上微调，通过投票策略集成多个BERT模型的预测结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于BERT的集成模型显著提升了Micro-F和Macro-F分数，分别提高了约5%和6%。

Conclusion: BERT集成模型在药物事件分类任务中表现优异，为临床数据分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

*Yumeng Lin,Xufeng Duan,David Haslett,Yige Chen,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据、语言距离和语系对多语言翻译中信息损失的影响，发现语言结构接近英语时翻译质量更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是训练数据有限或与英语差异大的语言）中仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似度指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 训练数据量和语言距离之间存在显著交互作用：数据充足可缓解语言差异影响，而结构接近英语的语言在低资源条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅受数据量影响，还受语言间结构和类型关系的制约。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATGen框架将主动学习（AL）与文本生成任务结合，通过人类注释者和基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动注释代理，减少NLG任务中的标注成本和API调用费用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注成本方面表现优异，但其在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中的应用有限，因此需要一种框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出ATGen框架，支持LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）作为服务或本地部署，提供统一平台实现和评估针对NLG任务的AL策略。

Result: ATGen显著减少了人类注释者的工作量和LLM API调用的成本，并在多种文本生成任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一种高效的AL解决方案，降低了标注成本，并支持灵活的LLM部署方式。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

### [50] [Perspective Dial: Measuring Perspective of Text and Guiding LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23377)
*Taejin Kim,Siun-Chuon Mau,Konrad Vesey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化和管理大型语言模型（LLM）输出视角的方法，包括Perspective Space和Systematic Prompt Engineering。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在关键任务中的广泛应用，但缺乏对其输出偏见和视角的量化理解，因此需要一种方法来控制和测量LLM的视角。

Method: 提出Perspective-Dial，包含Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 通过实证方法量化并调整LLM输出视角，适用于多种主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM偏见的检测、跟踪和缓解提供了潜在应用，如公共话语分析和辩论机器人。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于记忆组织的生成框架（MOG），通过分层记忆架构生成高质量的维基百科文章，提升信息性和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多源信息，确保准确性和结构化，现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: MOG框架从网络文档提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科式分层结构，并以此指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的评估表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架在真实场景中表现稳健，为自动生成高质量维基百科文章提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型公平性的评估依赖于基准数据集，但这些数据集本身的研究不足，可能导致偏见和局限性未被充分认识。

Method: 通过系统综述24个常用公平性基准数据集，提出统一评估框架，分析其来源、范围、内容和用途，揭示潜在的偏见。

Result: 研究发现数据集存在一致的群体差异，可能影响公平性结论，并提供了选择和解释数据集的实用指南。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁创建更反映多样社会背景的公平性基准，并更谨慎地使用现有数据集，所有数据和代码已公开以促进透明性。

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

### [53] [TuCo: Measuring the Contribution of Fine-Tuning to Individual Responses of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23423)
*Felipe Nuti,Tim Franzmeyer,João Henriques*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法（TuCo）量化微调对大型语言模型（LLM）输出的影响，通过分解模型为预训练和微调组件，并发现微调成分的调整可改变模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对微调如何影响LLM个体输出的定量分析，需要一种系统方法来衡量微调对模型响应的贡献。

Method: 通过追踪模型的中间隐藏状态，将微调模型分解为预训练和微调组件，并定义TuCo（微调贡献比）来衡量微调的影响。

Result: 发现微调成分的调整可改变模型行为，且TuCo在对抗攻击成功的提示中较低，表明微调效果的减弱与攻击成功相关。

Conclusion: TuCo为量化研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了工具，揭示了微调在对抗攻击中的作用。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的并行解码器架构，显著提高生成速度，同时保持生成质量和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型生成速度受限，需逐个生成标记，形成瓶颈。

Method: 提出流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列以实现并行。

Result: 在多项文本生成任务中，生成速度显著提升，且质量和内存消耗无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

TL;DR: ATF（自适应表过滤框架）通过问题感知的过滤流程减少表格中的无关列和行，提升大型语言模型在表格推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理大表格时因输入长度限制而表现不佳，需要一种方法在不重新训练模型的情况下优化表格输入。

Method: ATF利用LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，模块化地过滤无关列和行。

Result: 实验显示ATF减少约70%的表格单元格，提升了跨领域TableQA任务的性能，但在需要完整表格上下文的Table Fact Verification任务中略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应地在不同任务中平衡信息量和简洁性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的交互推荐代理因规划和泛化能力有限，难以有效处理多样且复杂的用户意图。

Method: TAIRA是一个多代理系统，采用思维模式蒸馏（TPD）方法，通过分解用户需求和规划子任务来增强代理的规划能力。

Result: 实验表明，TAIRA在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思维增强有效管理复杂用户意图，提升了交互推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Result: SFT快速学习但导致灾难性遗忘，RFT学习慢但保留知识。数据分布是关键因素。

Conclusion: RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在生成食谱时对训练数据的记忆程度、创造性合成能力以及产生的无意义内容，以评估其实际应用潜力。

Method: 通过人工标注20个LLM生成的食谱，分析其成分和步骤的记忆性、创造性和无意义性；设计自动化流程（LLM-as-judge）扩展研究规模。

Result: 发现Mixtral模型倾向于重用训练数据中的成分；自动化流程中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在成分匹配上达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化框架可大规模量化LLM生成内容的记忆性、创造性和无意义性，为模型创造力提供严谨证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

Result: 实验显示SemDiD在Best-of-N覆盖率提升1.4-5.2%，RLHF训练收敛加速15%，准确率提升2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

### [61] [Evaluating the Simulation of Human Personality-Driven Susceptibility to Misinformation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23610)
*Manuel Pratelli,Marinella Petrocchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs可以生成合成行为数据，但其是否能准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异尚不确定。研究发现，某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联可被LLM复制，但其他特质存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的数据是否能准确模拟人格特质对行为的影响，特别是对错误信息的易感性。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的参与者评估新闻标题准确性的数据集，创建匹配的LLM代理，并比较其与人类反应的差异。

Result: 某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联被LLM复制，但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力但也存在局限，为人工代理中认知多样性的建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Conclusion: BeamAttack高效但仍有局限，代码已开源。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料库访问，无需微调即可生成领域适应的嵌入，性能接近全访问模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知嵌入方法需要目标语料库访问或领域微调的问题，适用于隐私敏感或资源受限的环境。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域分布，冻结编码器使用代理语料库生成嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，仅用五个示例文档的ZEST性能接近全访问模型，差距仅0.5%。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性嵌入提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Method: 提出 L0 训练管道和 NB-Agent 框架，采用“代码即动作”模式，结合可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）进行训练。

Conclusion: L0 系统为通用智能代理的训练提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法全面评估大语言模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，需要更系统化的方法。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，支持多轮组合的原子进化操作，生成多样且具有挑战性的测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作平均导致模型准确率下降7.283%，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大，多步组合可放大对抗效应达52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需采用进化感知的鲁棒性评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，发现随着答案不确定性的增加，位置偏见呈指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化并分析大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下的表现。

Method: 通过改编SQuAD-it数据集，创建不同不确定性的版本，并评估两个高不确定性基准（WebGPT和Winning Arguments），计算偏好公平性和位置一致性。

Result: 位置偏见在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。

Conclusion: 位置偏见与答案不确定性密切相关，高不确定性条件下模型更容易受选项顺序影响。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: 论文提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO)算法，解决大型推理模型(LRMs)在简单任务中因过度思考导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理简单任务时，常因过度思考（如使用过多思考标记）导致效率低下，甚至影响正确推理。

Method: 提出DuP-PO算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Conclusion: 当前基准的有效性受到挑战，需开发更关注推理过程的评估协议，并发布了审计数据和工具以支持更透明的评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著进步，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化方法，结合CoT、自我反思和动态提示生成，逐步修正推理错误。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS显著优于标准CoT，并接近专用推理模型的性能。

Conclusion: MAPS通过平衡反思深度与成本，为LLMs提供了高效的多步推理解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有方法在评估LLM内部知识真实性时的缺陷，并开发更可靠的方法。

Method: 采用sAwMIL（稀疏感知多实例学习）方法，结合多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLM的内部激活来区分真实、虚假和中立的陈述。

Result: 研究发现：（1）真实性信号集中在LLM深度的第三部分；（2）真实和虚假信号不对称；（3）线性探针在聊天模型中表现更好；（4）非线性探针可能更适合某些LLM；（5）存在第三种信号，既非真实也非虚假。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLM内部知识的真实性提供了可靠方法，并揭示了其知识表达的新特性。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在处理语言复杂性上的不足，提出了改进空间，并公开了IMPACT框架以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Conclusion: 隐喻提示方法为低资源语言中的仇恨言论检测提供了创新解决方案，同时考虑了环境影响因素。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large

that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Conclusion: TaP框架高效且可扩展，显著提升LLM对齐能力。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Result: 展示了如何从有限科学文本中有效学习，识别误导性声明，并生成科学传播的新见解。

Conclusion: 论文为科学传播的自动化分析提供了实用工具和方法，有助于提升科学信息的忠实性。

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的全自动主题分析（TA）管道，用于分析临床叙事，减少人工编码需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手工主题分析（TA）耗时且难以扩展，而临床叙事中蕴含的患者和护理者经验未被充分挖掘。

Method: 采用多代理框架，由专门的LLM代理执行任务，并结合强化学习（RLHF）优化主题相关性。

Result: 实现了对大规模定性数据集的可扩展、以患者为中心的分析，并支持LLM在特定临床场景中的微调。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法为临床叙事分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学教育中的应用潜力，发现其能高效解决简单数学问题，但在理解真实世界情境方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，尤其是解决数学应用题的能力，以评估其作为教学工具的潜力。

Method: 通过技术概述、文献综述和对LLMs在数学应用题上的实证评估，综合分析其表现。

Result: LLMs在解决简单应用题（s-problems）上表现优异，但在处理需要真实世界情境理解的问题时表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能解决表面问题，但缺乏对应用题情境的深层理解，限制了其在数学课堂中的教学价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Conclusion: EXPERT提供了一种更可靠的图像描述评估方法，具有高质量的解释能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Method: 开发了一种新型few-shot-prompted分类器，并设计了STACK攻击方法进行红队测试。

Result: 新型分类器在ClearHarm数据集上攻击成功率为0%，但STACK攻击在相同数据集上达到71%成功率。

Conclusion: 防御管线存在漏洞，建议开发者采取特定措施应对分阶段攻击。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

TL;DR: 语言模型的预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度紧密相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的嵌入空间分散度与困惑度之间的关系，并探索如何利用分散度进行实际任务。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量间的平均余弦距离（分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并提出一种简单的推离目标以增加分散度。

Result: 分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于模型选择、优化检索方法，并直接提升困惑度。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的重要指标，可通过简单方法优化。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在检测圣经文本平行段落中的潜力。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE等模型生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估其检测平行段落的能力。

Result: E5在检测平行段落方面表现最佳，AlephBERT在区分非平行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可显著提升古代文本平行段落的检测效率和准确性，适用于更广泛的古代语言研究。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，用于结构健康监测中的裂缝演化跟踪，解决了传统方法在高频边缘保留和复杂环境下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和复杂环境（如阴影、遮挡）下表现不佳，需要一种更适应结构健康监测需求的解决方案。

Method: 采用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂缝保留的尺度空间，结合RANSAC-based单应性估计，无需训练或参数调优。

Result: 在多种复杂条件下，裂缝面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种无监督、轻量且物理基础牢固的图像对齐方案，适用于移动平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面评估计数任务的置信度，并通过模型量化影响因素与置信度的关系，为精准农业决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Motivation: 解决医院和长期护理设施中因床离导致的跌倒问题，现有商业警报仅在患者离开床后触发，无法提前预防。

Method: 使用四个负载传感器采集信号，转换为互补图像（RGB线图和三种纹理图），并设计双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）进行并行处理和跨模态融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法是一种实用且有效的实时隐私保护跌倒预防方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在训练过的冲突实体检测上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究提供了数据生成方法、开源数据集及对MLLMs知识一致性的分析，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决夜间因缺乏可见光而无法进行全天候气象观测的问题。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外数据，开发生成扩散模型RefDiff，实现夜间可见光反射率反演。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构区域表现显著优于经典模型，并通过VIIRS夜间产品验证。

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率反演能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Conclusion: RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中更具优势，适合集装箱损伤检测任务。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保留多个对象、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用N通道ControlNet，结合对象保留模块、背景引导模块和高频覆盖模块，确保细节保留和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在对象保留、语义一致性和用户控制方面表现卓越，为图像合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频目标检测中表现优异，但受限于计算资源，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本对数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，限制了基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，然后从9个教师模型中蒸馏1920万特征对。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在6类任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对多学科研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接多词地名，且忽视了几何信息。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT展示了其优势。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal

*Arunkumar Kannan,Martin A. Lindquist,Brian Caffo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMT是一种新型混合框架，通过结合双向Mamba块和Transformer块，有效捕捉fMRI数据中的长程时空依赖关系，显著提升了分类和回归任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积神经网络或Transformer的方法难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂关系，尤其是长程时空依赖。

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段框架：1) 双向Mamba块捕捉全局时间交互；2) Transformer块建模全局空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类（性别预测）和回归（认知智力预测）任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效学习长程时空属性，为fMRI数据分析提供了新的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

TL;DR: Seg-R1利用强化学习提升大型多模态模型的像素级理解能力，通过GRPO策略在分割任务中表现优异，并展现出强大的开放世界泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强大型多模态模型在像素级任务（如前景分割）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)策略，通过点提示和边界框提示引导SAM2生成分割掩码，仅使用RL训练。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，在RefCOCOg和ReasonSeg上分别实现71.4 cIoU和56.7 gIoU的零样本性能。

Conclusion: Seg-R1展示了纯RL训练在像素级任务中的有效性，并具备强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

*Sotirios Panagiotis Chytas,Miso Choi,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Vikas Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块ReCo，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLM）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合的方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）在生成文本时容易产生幻觉，即生成与视觉输入无关或矛盾的文本。这种行为被归因于对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的“记忆衰减效应”。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReCo的小型可训练模块，基于几何代数和关系组合，无需修改现有VLM架构即可缓解幻觉问题。

Result: 在InstructBLIP、LlaVA和MiniGPT4三种广泛使用的VLM上，ReCo模块显著减轻了记忆衰减效应，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。此外，ReCo还能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合使用，进一步改善结果。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种轻量级且通用的解决方案，能够有效缓解VLM中的幻觉问题，并与其他方法兼容，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Method: 提出了CaO$_2$框架，分为两阶段：概率信息样本选择管道和潜在表示细化，以优化条件似然。

Result: CaO$_2$在ImageNet及其子集上平均准确率提升2.3%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CaO$_2$通过解决不一致性问题，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且模型复杂度极低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性可显著提升盲超分辨率模型的性能与效率。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云中部分分割和运动估计的挑战，特别是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Result: 在遮挡情况下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云分析中表现优异，尤其适用于遮挡和动态采样场景。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于采样的6D姿态置信区域估计方法存在速度慢和置信区域过大的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准回归的高斯关键点分布，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著减小。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了紧凑且高效的6D姿态置信区域估计，优于现有采样方法。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法假设源图像质量高且对齐，实际中图像可能未对齐或质量差，导致融合效果下降。

Conclusion: UniFuse成功统一了对齐、恢复和融合任务，提升了多模态医学图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Method: 提出JGAU框架，包括几何上采样网络和属性上采样网络，结合两种粗属性上采样方法（GDWAI和DLAI）及属性增强模块。

Result: JGAU在4倍、8倍、12倍和16倍上采样率下的PSNR分别为33.90、32.10、31.10和30.39分贝，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JGAU通过联合优化几何和属性，显著提升了彩色点云的上采样质量。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了金属透镜成像中的退化问题，展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PhonemeFake（PF）攻击方法，通过语言推理操纵关键语音片段，显著降低人类感知和基准准确率，并开源了检测模型和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Deepfake（DF）数据集未能真实反映攻击对人类感知的影响，需要更现实的攻击向量。

Method: 引入PF攻击方法，操纵关键语音片段，并开发了双层DF片段检测模型，自适应优先计算操纵区域。

Result: PF攻击使人类感知降低42%，基准准确率降低94%；检测模型降低EER 91%，速度提升90%。

Conclusion: PF攻击和检测模型为DF攻击提供了更现实的评估和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

### [119] [Single-Frame Point-Pixel Registration via Supervised Cross-Modal Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22784)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的点-像素配准方法，用于LiDAR点云与相机图像的跨模态匹配，显著提升了稀疏单帧LiDAR条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异问题，特别是在稀疏单帧LiDAR条件下，现有方法因依赖多帧累积或手工匹配策略而表现不佳。

Method: 通过将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，并利用基于注意力的无检测器匹配网络直接估计跨模态对应关系，同时引入可重复性评分机制提升匹配可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中表现优异，优于依赖多帧点云的方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏单帧LiDAR条件下的点-像素配准问题，为自动驾驶和机器人感知提供了更可靠的跨模态匹配方案。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGE-GS是一种新颖的扩展重建框架，结合扩散生成和奖励引导的高斯积分，解决了3D高斯泼溅技术中累积物理不一致和训练效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次驾驶片段扫描通常导致道路结构不完整，传感器模拟器需要扩展重建场景以有效回归驾驶动作。

Method: RGE-GS框架包含两个关键创新：奖励网络选择性保留扩散输出以实现空间稳定性，以及根据场景收敛指标自动调整高斯优化进度的差异化训练策略。

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛评估表明，RGE-GS在重建质量上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过结合扩散生成和奖励引导的高斯积分，显著提升了重建质量和训练效率。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念瓶颈模型（CBM）的方法CBM-HNMU，通过自动识别和修正有害概念，提升深度模型的解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型复杂度增加导致解释性下降，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅针对样本级别。

Method: 利用CBM作为可解释框架，通过全局梯度贡献识别并修正有害概念，将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能，为深度学习的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

TL;DR: CP-Guard是一个针对协作感知（CP）的统一防御框架，通过概率无关的样本共识和动态阈值调整，有效检测并消除恶意代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作感知在多代理系统中提升性能，但易受恶意代理攻击，需解决这一安全问题。

Method: 提出PASAC方法进行样本共识验证，定义CCLoss捕捉差异，并通过动态阈值调整确保可靠性。

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测和消除恶意代理。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了可靠的防御机制，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code
will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard

Method: 引入非线性ResAGs模块，结合注意力锚定损失和对抗训练，选择性擦除目标概念。

Result: 在名人、艺术风格和敏感内容擦除任务中，CPE表现优于现有方法，且对攻击提示具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CPE通过非线性模块和对抗训练，实现了高效且鲁棒的概念擦除。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CORE的新嵌入范式，并基于此构建了文本水印框架CoreMark，显著提升了水印的鲁棒性、通用性和不可感知性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方案在同时实现鲁棒性、通用性和不可感知性方面面临挑战。

Method: CoreMark通过动态提取字符中的CORE（连续对齐的黑色像素段），选择鲁棒性强的字符，并通过调整CORE厚度嵌入数据。此外，提出了一种通用的嵌入强度调节器。

Result: 实验表明，CoreMark在多语言和字体中表现出色，显著提升了抗截图、打印扫描和打印相机攻击的能力，同时保持不可感知性。

Conclusion: CoreMark为文本水印提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDGT是一种频率自适应动态图变换器，通过整合频率自适应处理、动态图学习和多尺度时间解缠网络，显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑电图（EEG）情绪识别中因个体差异导致的跨被试泛化问题。

Method: 提出FreqDGT框架，包括频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN）。

Result: 实验表明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过整合频率、空间和时间建模，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is
available at https://github.com/NZWANG/FreqDGT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工设计的区域划分或特征空间，容易受虚假统计相关性干扰，难以应对开放世界中的新型攻击。

Method: CDAL显式建模注意力视觉痕迹与源模型归属的因果关系，反事实解耦判别性模型特定伪影与混淆源偏差。

Result: 在开放世界模型归属基准测试中，CDAL显著提升现有模型性能，尤其对未见的新型攻击表现优异。

Conclusion: CDAL通过最大化因果效应，鼓励网络捕捉泛化到未见源模型的生成模式，计算开销小且效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions
while preserving essential composition elements. Traditional saliency-aware
cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for

Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇3D场景理解中表现有限，主要受限于3D数据不足和多视图融合中的噪声问题。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码的精确区域级图像和文本特征，结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Matterport160数据集上，MVOV3D分别以14.7%和16.2%的mIoU刷新记录。

Conclusion: MVOV3D显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能，展示了多视图融合的潜力。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D

Motivation: 现有TPT方法因过度关注准确性而导致置信度校准下降，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。

Method: 1. 使用LLM初始化测试时提示以避免过拟合；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上，TCA方法的平均ECE为4.11，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: TCA方法有效解决了TPT的校准问题，提升了模型在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

Result: 在ImageReward基准上达到67.4%准确率，OOD性能提升6%，减少推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众奖励方案为视觉语言模型与人类偏好对齐提供了可扩展、高效的数据路径。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

Result: 实现了对特定面部语义的精确编辑，提升了辐射场的解耦能力。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑方面表现出色，为面部图像的局部控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网格去噪问题，提出一种结合图卷积和双流网络的新方法，以应对高噪声环境。

Method: 使用包含图卷积神经网络的双流网络结构，结合特征引导变换器（FGT）范式，包括特征提取器、变换器和去噪器。

Result: 在大规模3D数据集上训练，性能优于或与现有最先进算法相当，对高噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMD-Net在网格去噪中表现出色，各组件对性能至关重要，适用于高噪声场景。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

TL;DR: MaTIR任务结合了文本到图像检索（TIR）和参考表达式分割（RES），提出了一种两阶段框架，利用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP实现高效检索和精确分割。


<details>

Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，而RES在大规模图像集合中计算成本高，MaTIR旨在统一两者需求。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段利用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP进行分割感知检索；第二阶段使用MLLM重新排序并生成边界框。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索精度和分割质量显著提升。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和两阶段框架有效结合了检索与分割，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Motivation: 工业缺陷检测需要高精度分割，但传统方法依赖大量标注数据，与实际需求冲突。

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了高精度分割。

Conclusion: 该框架有效弥补了弱监督学习与高精度缺陷分割之间的差距，为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动扭曲和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR分数，结合潜在优化框架和潜在掩码生成视频。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在显著领域转换下表现优异。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过高效建模时空相关性，显著提升了视频编辑的时空一致性和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）直接将特征融合到分割模型中，导致动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠，降低了分割准确性。

Method: DeSa2VA通过文本预训练生成点级提示和文本掩码，利用线性投影解耦隐藏状态，并通过动态掩码融合策略结合解耦特征。

Result: 实验表明，DeSa2VA在图像分割、图像问答、视频分割和视频问答等任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合策略，显著提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息量，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息量，提出信息增益的度量方法，并验证其与嵌入范数的相关性。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益得分低的图像通常为占位图标，且信息增益与嵌入范数强相关（R²=0.98-1.00）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效量化语义信息量，适用于公开模型，计算成本低。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Conclusion: 结合隐式解码器的NCA框架能够高效扩展到高分辨率任务，适用于多种变体和应用场景。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Result: MOTOR在MedVQA数据集上平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态检索和重排序显著提升医学视觉问答的临床相关性和准确性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

Despite notable progress, challenges such as enhancing visual fidelity,
reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines
future directions, including hybrid compression frameworks and advanced feature
extraction strategies, to enable more efficient, immersive, and intelligent 3D

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

Result: BPT显著加速提示调优并提升准确率（如CUB数据集上提升>25%），同时减少参数和计算量。

Conclusion: BPT在多个基准数据集上优于现有VPT方法，展示了高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be

of noise to capture important visual features. To address these problems, this
investigation file introduces an innovative technique referred to as the
Cuttlefish Optimized Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CO- BRNN) for type
of scenes in remote sensing data. The investigation compares the execution of
CO-BRNN with current techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron- Convolutional
Neural Network (MLP-CNN), Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory
(CNN-LSTM), and Long Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (LSTM-CRF),
Graph-Based (GB), Multilabel Image Retrieval Model (MIRM-CF), Convolutional
Neural Networks Data Augmentation (CNN-DA). The results demonstrate that
CO-BRNN attained the maximum accuracy of 97%, followed by LSTM-CRF with 90%,
MLP-CNN with 85%, and CNN-LSTM with 80%. The study highlights the significance
of physical confirmation to ensure the efficiency of satellite data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 欧盟预测到2026年90%的在线内容可能是AI生成的，引发对政治虚假信息的担忧。加州通过法案要求AI生成内容加水印，但现有技术易被篡改。本文提出PECCAVI，一种抗视觉转述攻击的无失真水印技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成内容的水印易被篡改或绕过的问题，尤其是针对视觉转述攻击的防御。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声抛光技术保护非熔化点（NMPs），防止水印被移除。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵抗视觉转述攻击，保持图像无失真，且模型无关。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为AI生成内容的水印技术提供了更安全的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActAlign是一种零样本细粒度视频分类框架，通过序列对齐和动态时间规整（DTW）在共享嵌入空间中匹配视频帧与语言模型生成的子动作序列，无需视频文本监督或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类问题，传统对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉关键的时间结构。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过DTW在共享嵌入空间中对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准测试中达到30.5%准确率，优于亿参数视频语言模型且参数更少。

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，可扩展且通用地释放视觉语言模型在细粒度视频理解中的潜力。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

TL;DR: FewCLIP提出了一种概率原型校准框架，通过多模态原型学习改进广义少样本语义分割（GFSS），显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法在少样本语义分割中缺乏适应性，尤其是对标注稀缺的新类别。FewCLIP旨在通过概率原型校准提升模型的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: FewCLIP结合了原型校准机制和分布正则化，通过可学习的视觉校准原型优化冻结的文本原型，并引入概率建模以减少过拟合。

Result: 在PASCAL-5^i和COCO-20^i数据集上，FewCLIP在GFSS和类增量设置中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准和多模态学习，有效提升了少样本语义分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究强调了VLMs对抗脆弱性的重要性，提供了更鲁棒的对抗样本生成框架，对实际应用中的安全性有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant

establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet
understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集的像素级标注成本高且耗时，如何在标注数据稀缺的情况下提升分割性能是关键挑战。

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的标注数据增强方法，解决了标注稀缺问题。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

Result: 实验表明，AutoOpti3DGS仅需一个超参数，生成更稀疏的场景表示，兼容内存受限硬件。

Conclusion: AutoOpti3DGS有效平衡了视觉保真度和内存效率，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Result: 在OpenCompass、DPG-Bench、GenEval等基准测试中表现优异，超越Ristretto-3B和SAIL-VL-1.5-2B。

Conclusion: Ovis-U1作为统一模型系列的首个版本，在多模态任务中展现了显著优势，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: DyME是一种动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式的训练范式，显著提升了小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）的思维可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SVLMs参数容量有限且指令跟随能力弱，现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）对其要求过高，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃，影响性能和可靠性。

Method: 提出DyME，动态选择SFT（记忆）和RLVR（探索）模式，确保每次优化更新都能平衡两者，避免次优收敛。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升SVLMs的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: DyME是提升SVLMs思维可靠性的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Conclusion: FMC-Net通过频率增强和多粒度上下文显著提高了脊椎分割的准确性。

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的驾驶员注意力预测任务范式（W3DA），结合空间注意力区域预测、语义解析和认知推理，并提出了LLada框架，通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅预测驾驶员注视的空间热图，未能捕捉特定情境下注意力分配的认知动机，限制了注意力机制的深入理解。

Method: 引入W3DA数据集，提供语义和因果标注，并提出LLada框架，统一像素建模、语义解析和认知推理。

Result: LLada在实验中表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于多种数据集和驾驶条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解驾驶员注意力机制提供了关键步骤，对自动驾驶、智能驾驶培训和人类-计算机交互有重要意义。

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新颖的测试时适应框架，通过用户交互监督改进SAM在复杂场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中的局限性。

Method: 将用户点击分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，最后合并模型。

Result: DC-TTA显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效提升了SAM在复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过选择性移除笔画来简化多笔画汉字的方法，旨在降低学习难度并提升字体设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多笔画汉字对非母语学习者构成挑战，简化字符可降低学习门槛并优化字体设计。

Method: 利用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性移除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 实验表明，即使移除多笔画，许多字符仍可区分，为简化策略提供依据。

Conclusion: 研究为多笔画汉字的系统性简化提供了潜在方案。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在多视图分类中忽视了表示学习和类别特征的差异，导致CPG任务表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVC-RF框架，包含语料库级、视图级和类别级的多级细化，采用中心记忆对比损失、级联下采样注意力模块和无参数专家混合加权策略。

Result: 实验表明CVC-RF在多级细化下有效建模全局特征，在CPG任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化显著提升了CPG的准确性，为临床实践提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

TL;DR: MoCa是一个两阶段框架，将预训练的因果视觉语言模型（VLM）转化为高效的双向多模态嵌入模型，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据以及训练目标和数据多样性不足的问题。

Method: MoCa分为两阶段：第一阶段通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文感知；第二阶段利用多样化的多模态数据进行对比微调。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新的最先进水平，并展现出良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Result: 实验表明，R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Method: 构建数据集，使用DINOv2模型进行相似性检索和分类，并通过微调优化检索性能。

Result: 基线方法识别准确率97.2%，但检索精度低（29.0% AP）；微调后检索性能提升12% AP，但识别准确率降至92.7%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进方向，讨论了检索性能与识别准确率的权衡。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

Motivation: 当前城市研究方法通常针对特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架处理多模态数据，而多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的成功为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: 通过构建多样化的城市指令数据集，并提出多阶段训练框架，将空间推理增强与领域知识学习解耦，提升模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，UrbanLLaVA在单模态和跨模态任务中均优于开源和专有MLLMs，并展现出跨城市的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态数据处理框架，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示与模型偏好的提示之间存在差距，导致生成的图像语义对齐不足。

Method: 利用自动反思模块识别缺失概念，并通过细粒度优化机制修订提示。

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐评估基准上达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter具有即插即用设计，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过预训练生成模型合成的中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），导致3D重建性能下降。

Method: AlignCVC通过分布对齐将生成和重建的多视图分布与真实多视图分布对齐，提出软硬对齐策略，分别优化生成和重建模型。

Result: 实验表明AlignCVC显著提升了CVC和生成质量，同时将推理加速至仅需4步。

Conclusion: AlignCVC作为一种即插即用范式，有效整合了多视图生成与3D重建模型，为单图像到3D生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前光流估计方法在高分辨率（如FullHD）输入下GPU内存消耗过高，限制了训练和推理的效率。

Method: 通过优化RAFT-like架构的设计选择，结合减少的相关体积和高分辨率训练协议，实现多帧估计。

Result: MEMFOF在多个基准测试中表现优异，内存消耗显著降低（运行时2.09GB，训练时28.5GB），并在Spring、Sintel和KITTI-2015上取得最佳成绩。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在保持高精度的同时显著降低了内存需求，适用于高分辨率光流估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了小相机运动场景中的几何表示和相机参数估计问题，提升了新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架，用于高动态场景重建，通过事件相机补偿帧相机的不足，区分背景与物体的时空特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用统一表示模型（如高斯）难以处理动态场景中潜在的时空特征不匹配问题，尤其是背景与物体之间的异质性。

Method: 引入事件相机，提出时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架，通过聚类区分背景与物体的时空特征，并利用高斯表示与事件数据的一致性指导解耦。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在高动态场景重建中的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过时空解耦和事件相机的引入，显著提升了动态场景的时空分辨率和重建效果。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Result: 在多个基准测试和消融研究中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: Trident框架通过增强适应性和鲁棒性，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的性能。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

TL;DR: MotionGPT3是一个双模态运动-语言模型，通过分离运动建模参数和共享注意力机制，解决了运动与语言统一建模中的重建差距和语言智能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面取得了进展，但运动-语言统一模型的发展仍不足。需要解决运动模态与离散表示的重建差距以及统一训练中语言智能退化的问题。

Method: 提出MotionGPT3，通过运动变分自编码器（VAE）将运动编码为潜在表示，运动分支通过扩散头直接从隐藏状态预测运动潜在表示，避免离散化。文本分支保留预训练语言模型的结构和参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动理解和生成任务中表现优异，同时保持了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3在自回归框架内建立了统一的运动扩散双模态模型，为运动-语言统一建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上，HAMW实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HAMW通过高频增强和多波混合技术显著提升了Transformer模型的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能明确建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过潜在扩散和最优传输路径，显著提升了3D形状补全的全局一致性和细节生成能力。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Motivation: 现有RGB-only SLAM系统过度依赖光度渲染损失，导致在户外环境中因视角和光照变化而鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出三视图匹配模块和混合几何约束，结合光度损失和几何约束优化相机位姿估计；采用概率初始化策略和动态渲染信任衰减机制。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和渲染质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在广泛的应用中表现出显著的性能和效率提升。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Result: SATs能够解释任何可生成显著性图的分类器，提供介于全局和局部之间的实用分析工具。

Conclusion: SATs为分析和调试图像分类器提供了一种实用方法，填补了现有解释方法的不足。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

TL;DR: PCLVis框架通过MPI通信数据分析和可视化，帮助用户优化大规模模拟中的通信延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模拟中的通信延迟问题限制了其可扩展性，现有方法依赖管理员权限的物理链路信息，PCLVis旨在为普通用户提供无需物理信息的分析工具。

Method: 1. 基于MPI通信数据，通过进程相关性树聚类高相关进程；2. 构建通信依赖DAG分析PCL事件传播路径；3. 设计CS-Glyph展示进程通信状态；4. 提出PCL事件归因策略。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上的实验表明，PCLVis能有效帮助用户优化模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路信息的通信延迟分析框架，显著提升了模拟效率。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Motivation: 为自动驾驶汽车的安全测试提供合成的事故视频，以模拟现实中难以承受的事故场景。

Method: 提出Causal-VidSyn扩散模型，利用事故原因描述和驾驶员注视点，通过事故原因回答和注视条件选择模块实现因果实体定位。

Result: Causal-VidSyn在帧质量和因果敏感性方面优于现有视频扩散模型，支持多种任务如事故视频编辑、正常到事故视频扩散和文本到视频生成。

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过结合因果关系和驾驶员注视数据，显著提升了合成事故视频的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)解释性不足的问题，通过因果推断和高斯滤波减少冗余激活干扰，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的解释性研究不足，冗余的上下文激活干扰了模型的可靠解释，影响了理解和可视化效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果推断的Token Activation Map (TAM)方法，结合高斯滤波减少激活噪声，专注于多令牌交互的解释。

Result: TAM方法在多种场景下表现出色，如目标定位、失败案例分析、视频可视化等，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM方法有效提升了MLLMs的解释性和可视化质量，为模型理解提供了新工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Motivation: 解决大规模预训练Transformer模型在下游音频-视觉任务中内存消耗大和训练时间长的问题。

Method: 使用Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)模块并行蒸馏特征为元标记，并通过Meta-Token Injection (MTI)模块支持细粒度任务。

Result: 在多个音频-视觉基准测试中显著减少内存和训练时间，同时保持参数效率和准确性。

Conclusion: Mettle是一种简单高效的方法，适用于多种音频-视觉任务。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoT2IS在文本到图像集生成任务中表现出色，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Motivation: 视频异常检测（VAD）是计算机视觉中的重要问题，传统基于似然的方法无法检测靠近学习分布的局部异常。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 构建噪声条件评分变换器进行去噪评分匹配；2. 引入场景依赖和运动感知评分函数；3. 提出自回归去噪评分匹配机制，增强异常感知。

Result: 在三个流行的VAD基准测试中，该方法表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过综合考虑场景、运动和外观三个方面的差距，该方法能够更全面地检测视频异常。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Conclusion: MoMa通过高效的时空建模，显著提升了视频理解性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Motivation: 虚拟试穿（VTON）在电子商务和数字时尚中有广泛应用，但现有方法在保留服装细节、对齐精度和效率上仍有不足。

Method: DiffFit采用两阶段策略：第一阶段通过几何感知的服装变形对齐目标身体；第二阶段通过跨模态条件扩散模型细化纹理。

Result: DiffFit在大型VTON基准测试中表现优于现有方法，定量和感知评估均显示其优越性。

Conclusion: DiffFit通过解耦几何对齐和外观细化，显著提升了虚拟试穿的生成稳定性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX在机器人辅助手术应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和推理效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用型VLAs提供了数据与评估协议，推动通过创建实现真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine

promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

TL;DR: GeoProg3D是一个视觉编程框架，通过自然语言实现城市规模高保真3D场景的交互，结合地理感知和视觉API，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言交互方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市环境的能力。

Method: 提出GeoProg3D框架，包含地理感知城市规模3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用LLM动态组合工具。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D首次实现了通过自然语言在城市规模3D环境中进行组合地理推理。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像在复杂天气条件下（如雾、雨、低光）能提升自动驾驶感知能力，但低对比度问题（尤其是非热辐射目标）影响下游视觉任务性能，且增强对比度时需避免噪声放大和信息丢失。

Method: 方法包括层分解和显著性信息提取。层分解增强场景细节并保留暗区特征；基于形态学重建的显著性提取方法有效增强目标信息而不放大噪声。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了红外图像质量，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了更优的输入。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主题场景，且缺乏对多主题训练数据对和控制信号（如深度、遮罩等）的研究。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构建管道和IVTM训练方法，结合扩散Transformer框架OmniVCus，采用Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多主题视频定制和控制信号利用方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享隐式编码器和离散解码器，显著加速了隐式神经表示（INR）的视频编码速度，同时保持高质量重建和压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有INR编码速度过慢的问题，同时避免牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制能力。

Method: SIEDD采用共享的坐标编码器快速捕获全局低频特征，并并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，SIEDD实现了20-30倍的编码速度提升，同时保持竞争性的重建质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了可扩展且高效的路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时存在偏差，难以准确反映输入提示中的空间配置。

Method: 提出了PoS框架，包括PSE评估指标和PSG生成方法，后者通过梯度引导或搜索策略优化空间关系生成。

Result: PSE指标比传统方法更符合人类判断，PSG显著提升了模型在空间关系生成上的表现。

Conclusion: PoS框架为文本到图像模型的空间关系生成提供了更可靠的方法和评估标准。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从传统的基于类别的分类转向对物体危害性的判定，以提升自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）依赖目标检测模型识别周围环境，但传统方法无法有效检测和分类分布外（OOD）物体，存在安全隐患。

Method: 通过评估物体相对于AV的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升AV在动态环境中的决策能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了AV对未知物体的检测和响应能力，提高了安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR世界模型领域适应性差的问题，探索跨领域转移能力。

Method: 提出基于潜在条件流匹配（CFM）的框架，优化数据压缩和训练目标。

Conclusion: 新框架在语义占用预测和计算效率上达到SOTA，显著提升LiDAR模型的通用性和效率。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Result: PathDiff生成高质量、语义准确的图像，提升下游任务（如核分割和分类）的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: PathDiff在图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和忠实度方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法在弱监督语义分割中存在部分激活和边界不精确的问题，而基于条件扩散模型（CDM）的方法则容易受到背景噪声的干扰。

Method: 通过结合CDM生成的梯度图和CAM，利用对比学习训练像素解码器，将扩散特征映射到低维嵌入空间，以减少假阳性/假阴性。

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务上，CLDF方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CLDF方法通过对比学习有效解决了扩散特征中的噪声问题，提升了弱监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 实验表明，InDiTE-Diff在TAMP任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff有效解决了时间变异图像修复问题，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Conclusion: VLSR显著提升数据集质量，减少人工干预，适用于工业场景的鲁棒模型训练。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上，AdFair-CLIP显著提升公平性和诊断准确性，且在零样本和少样本场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型设定了公平性学习的新标准，尤其在胸部X光分析中。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to execute sequential navigation actions in complex environments guided
by natural language instructions. Current approaches often struggle with
generalizing to novel environments and adapting to ongoing changes during
navigation. Inspired by human cognition, we present NavMorph, a self-evolving
world model framework that enhances environmental understanding and
decision-making in VLN-CE tasks. NavMorph employs compact latent
representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with
foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement. By integrating a novel
Contextual Evolution Memory, NavMorph leverages scene-contextual information to
support effective navigation while maintaining online adaptability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance

*Pedro Alonso,Tianrui Li,Chongshou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GeoCD，一种基于拓扑感知和完全可微的测地距离近似方法，用于改进3D点云学习中的Chamfer Distance（CD）指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性，因此需要一种更有效的度量方法。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微的测地距离近似方法，用于替代CD。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在不同架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需单次微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的改进CD的方法，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅的自适应图像表示框架，显著减少训练时间并动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高斯泼溅方法训练速度慢和固定高斯点数量限制适应性的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，并通过少量微调步骤优化，同时动态调整高斯点数量。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，方法在减少训练时间一个数量级的同时，达到或超过现有方法的渲染性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和适应性上优于现有技术，为图像表示提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: MTADiffusion通过改进语义对齐、结构稳定性和风格一致性，显著提升了对象修复的效果。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B
parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling
and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in
high-resolution desktop scenarios. The Qwen-GUI-3B is available at:

Result: 在多种自监督模型（如DINO、MoCo、iBOT）上验证了方法的有效性，即使无源预训练也能取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 自监督TTA协议和协作学习框架为动态环境中的模型适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

*Mengxiao Tian,Xinxiao Wu,Shuo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM增强的动作感知多模态提示调优方法，以提升CLIP模型在细粒度动作理解上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本匹配任务中表现出色，但缺乏对细粒度动作的理解能力，影响了对物体状态或关系的描述。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的动作相关知识，并通过自适应交互模块聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了CLIP模型在动作感知任务中的性能。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上达到76.9%的top-1准确率，性能接近传统ViT。

Conclusion: GVIT通过高斯表示和梯度指导，实现了高效且性能接近传统方法的分类。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升了对抗多种物理可实现攻击的鲁棒性，检测准确率提升29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT是一种有效的统一防御方法，适用于多种物理可实现攻击。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over

Motivation: 注视信息更易获取且更符合人眼真实视觉模式，因此论文旨在利用注视信息辅助弱监督下的视频显著物体检测。

Conclusion: 通过引入注视信息和创新模块设计，论文在弱监督下显著提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现实时性能，并通过真实机器人实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、轻量，显著提升自动驾驶性能，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练基础模型在特定领域性能下降，需针对性评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 利用LLM生成领域特定的图像扰动，无需标注数据，评估多种视觉语言模型。

Result: 不同模型在六个真实领域中的鲁棒性差异显著。

Conclusion: Deepbench开源，支持领域感知的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-Event跟踪算法依赖高复杂度Vision Transformer，导致计算开销大且跨模态交互效果受限。

Method: 设计轻量级Prompt Generator生成模态特定提示向量，结合Vision Mamba的FEMamba主干实现特征提取与融合。

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，通过跨帧几何注意力提升时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ToF传感器捕获的深度图像易受噪声影响，现有方法未充分考虑跨帧深度变化，导致时空不一致。

Method: 利用图的时序自相似性进行图融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题，并通过迭代滤波器实现。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集和真实Kinectv2数据集上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在时空一致性和泛化性上表现优异，且网络可解释性强。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Conclusion: SPROD是一种高效且通用的OOD检测方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiTs的计算成本，同时保持生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统DiTs中固定patch大小导致的计算效率问题，提出动态调整patch大小以适应不同噪声水平的timesteps。

Method: 采用Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow)，在高噪声timesteps使用大patch，低噪声timesteps使用小patch，并为每种patch大小学习线性投影。

Result: 训练结果显示，PPFlow在推理速度上比SiT-B/2快1.6倍（2级金字塔）或2.0倍（3级金字塔），且训练FLOPs略低，生成性能相似。

Conclusion: PPFlow是一种高效且性能优越的方法，尤其适合从预训练DiTs微调，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务，通过简单但高效的两步模型实现广泛适用性。

Method: 使用Y-Net和C-Net分别预测eigenTF和CCM参数，通过K个可学习令牌支持多风格。

Result: 实验表明Oneta能有效处理六种增强任务，覆盖30个数据集。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效且通用的多风格图像增强算法。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a

Motivation: 当前基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理困难样本时表现不佳，且现有方法未考虑人脸质量或识别难度。

Method: 提出基于vMF分布的相似性度量，引入自适应边缘的softmax分类方法，并结合代理损失函数优化表示空间分布。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，优于第二名2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边缘和代理约束，显著提升了高质量困难样本的识别性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心辐射场（OcRF）的方法，通过增强3D体素特征和2D BEV特征，提升了多视角3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码隐式地将2D特征转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。作者假设辐射场可以增强3D几何估计能力，但直接使用时性能下降。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于前景物体建模，避免背景噪声。通过高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过前景建模和注意力机制显著提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet为事件相机在反无人机任务中的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现零样本异常检测和分割任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP通过堆叠提示和模块化设计显著提升模型泛化能力和性能，适用于工业异常检测任务。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、即插即用的幻觉缓解方法CAI，通过利用LVLMs对标题查询的注意力模式，显著减少视觉信息偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在解释视觉信息时经常产生与视觉内容不符的幻觉，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或增加推理时间。

Method: 利用LVLMs对标题查询的注意力模式，提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI)方法，增强视觉感知能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI以最小的额外推理成本实现了最先进的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且低成本的幻觉缓解方法，适用于判别性和生成性任务。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的合成幻灯片生成方法SynLecSlideGen，并通过实验证明其能有效提升少样本迁移学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决幻灯片元素检测和检索任务中标注数据不足的问题，减少人工标注成本。

Method: 使用LLM生成高质量合成幻灯片（SynLecSlideGen），并创建真实标注数据集RealSlide进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据预训练显著优于仅使用真实数据训练。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效弥补标注数据不足，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on
our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

Result: SG-LDM在生成质量和下游分割任务中显著优于现有方法，翻译框架进一步提升了数据增强效果。

Conclusion: SG-LDM为激光雷达点云生成和跨域翻译提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种两阶段训练策略，通过部分到全局的课程学习改进开放词汇3D语义分割，利用多视角图像的丰富语义和跨视角一致性提升模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将多视角图像作为传递开放词汇信息的中介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视角对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: PGOV3D采用两阶段训练：第一阶段在部分场景预训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签；第二阶段在完整场景微调，通过伪标签桥接语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过充分利用多视角图像的语义和一致性，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

*Ziao Liu,Zhenjia Li,Yifeng Shi,Xiangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3DGS对高质量点云的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，在纹理缺失或视角受限的场景中表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: AttentionGS结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节；使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密度化。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionGS在点云初始化不可靠的场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种高效的基于扩散的视频超分辨率模型，通过高压缩比自动编码器、分解条件和快捷模型设计，实现了100倍以上的加速，同时保持与现有方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，处理短视频耗时过长。TurboVSR旨在解决这一效率问题。

Method: TurboVSR采用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量，引入分解条件降低训练复杂度，并将预训练扩散模型转换为快捷模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR在性能上与现有方法相当，但速度提升100倍以上，仅需7秒处理2秒1080p视频，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计解决了扩散模型的效率问题，为更高分辨率的超分辨率任务提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种视觉中心Transformer（VCT）框架，通过视觉驱动的查询解决音频中心Transformer在音频-视觉分割中的感知模糊和细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频中心Transformer在音频-视觉分割中存在感知模糊和视觉细节丢失的局限性。

Method: 提出VCT框架，利用视觉驱动的查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息，并引入PPQG模块生成语义丰富且视觉细节保留的查询。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够在不额外训练的情况下，将多个概念的关键属性融合为单一新颖图像，探索其创造性和组合潜力。

Method: 提出四种概念融合方法，分别利用扩散流程的不同方面（如提示调度、嵌入插值或分层条件），并通过系统实验和用户研究评估其效果。

Result: 扩散模型展现出创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同条件下表现最佳，结果受提示顺序、概念距离和随机种子等因素影响。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入细节敏感，需根据场景选择合适方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Conclusion: 通过弥合视觉与文本表示的差距，推动了更高效多模态基础模型的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往不可得，因此探索利用MLLMs提供补充信息。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs获取描述，提出原型条件机制增强生成器对新描述组合的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种医学图像数据集上的实验验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过结合MLLMs的外部知识，显著提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Partial Forward Blocking (PFB)的新框架，通过自适应剪枝管道和概率密度指标，显著减少训练计算成本，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型训练数据集的不断增长带来了高昂的计算成本，现有数据剪枝方法依赖梯度或代理模型，增加了额外开销。

Method: PFB通过浅层特征评估样本重要性，剪枝不重要样本，仅保留重要样本进行后续前向传播和反向传播，减少计算开销。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PFB在剪枝40%数据的情况下，实现了0.5%的准确率提升和33%的训练时间减少。

Conclusion: PFB是一种高效且无损的训练加速框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: Vision Transformer计算成本高，传统剪枝方法在未见数据域中表现不佳，导致资源分配不理想。

Method: P3B利用块级相对贡献全局分配参数，识别低影响组件并保留关键部分，通过层间保留比例确保后期收敛块的激活。

Result: P3B在高稀疏度（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，能有效平衡计算成本和模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Result: 在ACM MM25竞赛中获得第一名，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了扩散模型在对抗样本生成中的泛化和迁移问题，适用于更广泛的任务。

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynMotion是一个新的视频生成模型，通过结合语义指导和视觉适应，解决了现有方法在视频运动定制中语义与视觉平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频运动定制中要么过于依赖语义对齐，导致忽略视觉复杂性，要么仅调整视觉表示，导致语义混淆。SynMotion旨在同时利用语义和视觉信息，提升运动定制效果。

Method: SynMotion采用双嵌入语义理解机制分离主体和运动表示，并集成参数高效的运动适配器以增强运动保真度。此外，使用交替优化的训练策略和SPV数据集。

Result: 实验表明，SynMotion在文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合语义和视觉优化，实现了高质量的运动定制视频生成，并在新基准MotionBench上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

*Smriti Joshi,Richard Osuala,Lidia Garrucho,Kaisar Kushibar,Dimitri Kessler,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于补丁的多视图协同训练方法，用于单图像测试时适应，解决了临床场景中实时适应和数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床场景中需要实时适应但目标域数据稀缺，现有方法依赖大数据且未充分利用医学影像的体素信息。

Method: 通过不确定性引导的自训练实现特征和预测一致性，仅需单张测试图像即可进行体素分割。

Result: 在三个公开的乳腺MRI数据集上，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice相似系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺的临床场景中表现优异，代码已开源，便于集成到nnUNet框架。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera 是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在用户主观输入偏差、平面草图与3D先验之间的模态差距以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型模型或不切实际的草图精度。

Method: 采用概念顺序生成框架，通过文本奖励优化建立外观先验，顺序感知解耦生成处理草图顺序，并利用潜在优化桥接模态差距。

Result: 在多样数据集上验证，方法在语义和空间一致性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera 提供了一种无需训练且适应性强的方法，能够高效地将主观感知转化为真实图像。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨模型协同学习框架COCA，用于测试时适应（TTA），通过互补知识和自我适应策略显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响TTA过程，发现不同模型可以提供互补知识，即使模型规模差异显著。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含两种策略：1) 协同适应（整合互补知识）；2) 自我适应（增强模型独特优势）。

Result: COCA显著提升了现有SOTA方法，例如将ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的适应准确率从51.7%提高到64.5%。

Conclusion: COCA作为一种即插即用模块，能够有效提升不同规模模型的TTA性能。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/ycarobot/COCA.

TL;DR: Proteus-ID是一个基于扩散的框架，用于身份一致和运动连贯的视频定制，通过多模态身份融合、时间感知身份注入和自适应运动学习解决挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，需要一种新方法来同时满足这两点。

Method: 提出Proteus-ID框架，包含多模态身份融合模块、时间感知身份注入机制和自适应运动学习策略。

Result: 实验表明Proteus-ID在身份保留、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制设定了新基准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

*Annika Mütze,Sadia Ilyas,Christian Dörpelkus,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据挑战开放词汇目标检测器，发现其局限性，尤其是对物体位置的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据难以系统评估其泛化能力。

Method: 设计两条自动化流水线，使用稳定扩散模型在真实数据集上生成合成数据，评估多种检测器。

Result: 合成数据能有效挑战检测器，发现其对物体位置的依赖强于语义。

Conclusion: 研究为挑战和改进开放词汇检测器提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

TL;DR: VisTex-OVLM是一种新颖的图像提示目标检测方法，通过视觉文本化增强对象级视觉语言模型（OVLM）对罕见类别的检测能力，同时保持其预训练的对象-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见类别难以用文本描述且预训练数据中几乎不存在的问题，同时保持模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本化视觉标记，指导OVLM。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在不改变OVLM架构的情况下，显著提升了罕见类别的检测性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

TL;DR: CRefDiff是一种基于扩散模型的新型可控参考超分辨率方法，通过双分支融合机制和预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，解决了现有RefSR方法在真实世界遥感图像中的不足，并显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实世界复杂场景（如跨传感器分辨率差异和显著地物变化）中表现不佳，导致生成不足或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，提出双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并引入Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了下游任务（如场景分类和语义分割）的性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过创新设计和高效推理，为真实世界遥感图像超分辨率提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

### [272] [Towards Initialization-free Calibrated Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23808)
*Carl Olsson,Amanda Nilsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入相对旋转估计，实现无初始化的近度量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无初始化BA方法使用pOSE目标函数，但无法利用相机标定信息，导致重建结果仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，结合相机标定信息，将旋转平均整合到pOSE框架中，实现无初始化的标定SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标函数，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最小值，生成准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将相机标定信息融入无初始化重建，显著提升了重建的度量精度。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Conclusion: 该方法无需合成数据或内存库，通过组件消融实验验证了各部分的贡献，代码已开源。

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The
code is available at https://github.com/mahshid1998/MadCLIP.

Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性。LaZSL旨在通过局部对齐视觉特征与属性，解决这一问题。

Method: LaZSL利用最优传输技术，实现视觉区域与对应属性的局部对齐，无需额外训练即可提供可解释的相似性。

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在可解释性、准确性和领域泛化能力方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种有效方法，兼具性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Motivation: 现有模型在处理长视频时存在计算和内存开销大的问题，且难以泛化到更长的视频。

Method: 提出Flash-VStream，包含低容量上下文记忆模块和高容量增强记忆模块，分别用于聚合长上下文信息和检索详细空间信息。

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中（如EgoSchema、MLVU等）实现了最先进的性能和高效推理。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream为长视频理解提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Conclusion: NH2ST有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为基因表达预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力在分类任务中的学习机制，并将其推广到大规模MHA（LS-MHA），以提升分类精度和效率。

Method: 使用单头性能（SHP）矩阵量化多头注意力的表现，类比CNN中的单滤波器性能，并设计不同的ViT架构。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵包含多个单元簇，每个标签由少数头明确识别，提高了信噪比和分类精度，同时通过卷积层替换减少了延迟。

Conclusion: 该机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解，实验基于CIFAR-100数据集验证。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像比较方法在处理不同分辨率的二值图像时存在局限性，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 通过将二值图像转换为标记点模式表示，提取关键特征（锚点），并使用总结向量比较图像的强度、连通性、复杂性和结构属性。

Result: PointSSIM提供了一种高效可靠的图像比较方法，特别适用于需要跨分辨率结构分析的应用。

Conclusion: PointSSIM是一种有效的跨分辨率二值图像比较工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAISE是一种新颖的3D增强框架，利用3D生成先验恢复缺失视角下的细粒度物体几何和外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中因视角缺失导致的高保真物体级建模难题，推动需要详细物体理解的下游任务发展。

Method: 通过两阶段优化：先替换退化物体为代理，再逐步对齐和修正几何与纹理。

Result: 在视角合成和几何补全任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAISE成功实现高保真物体建模，同时保持场景一致性，为相关领域提供有力工具。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），评估现有VQA模型在RGC视频质量评估中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人视频在流媒体平台的普及，RGC视频的感知质量对人类-机器人交互至关重要，但目前缺乏专门的研究。

Method: 建立包含2,100个RGC视频的数据库（RGCD），进行主观VQA实验，并评估11种现有VQA模型的性能。

Result: 实验显示现有VQA模型在复杂RGC视频上表现不佳，需开发RGC专用模型。

Conclusion: RGCD填补了RGC视频质量评估的空白，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一的神经表面重建框架，解决了多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强导致的结构退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以平衡几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一管道解决这些问题。

Method: 1) SDF引导的射线追踪进行微分可见性验证；2) 平面共形正则化；3) 基于物理的Eikonal松弛。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提升2.32 dB。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化外观和几何约束，实现了细节保留和全局一致性的平衡，适用于逆向渲染任务。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类信息（TCI）的动态提示解决Base-New Tradeoff（BNT）问题，显著提升模型在新任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法性能不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现基于文本类信息（TCI）的动态提示是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习基于TCI的动态提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT可作为插件提升现有无条件提示调优方案的性能。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，且计算成本几乎不变。结合DePT框架的DeCaPT方法在性能上优于现有最佳条件提示调优方案3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI条件提示有效解决BNT问题，提升模型泛化能力，且计算成本低，适用于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种针对视频扩散模型（VDMs）的新型稀疏注意力机制，通过改进MoBA框架，显著提升了训练和推理效率，同时保持或超越全注意力的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视频扩散模型在生成长时长、高分辨率视频时的效率，而现有稀疏注意力方法未能充分利用视频数据的时空特性。

Method: VMoBA通过层间循环块分区（1D-2D-3D）、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择，动态适应时空注意力模式，优化查询-键块交互。

Result: VMoBA在训练中实现了2.92倍FLOPs和1.48倍延迟加速，在推理中实现了2.40倍FLOPs和1.35倍延迟加速，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA是一种高效且性能优越的稀疏注意力机制，适用于视频扩散模型的训练和推理。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角3D重建中训练数据多样性和规模不足的问题。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和场景几何，生成高质量的训练数据。

Result: 在仅使用10%原始数据的情况下，模型性能仍与完整数据集相当。

Conclusion: Puzzles能有效提升3D重建模型的性能，且无需修改网络架构。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow是一个双分支框架，通过正交视图减少全景光流中的失真，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视角的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其是在极地区域。

Method: 提出PriOr-Flow框架，引入DCCL操作符和ODDC模块，联合利用原始和正交成本体积信息，减少失真。

Result: 在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow有效解决了全景光流中的失真问题，为宽视场运动估计设定了新标准。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 解决超声图像中因解剖变异、成像协议多样和标注数据有限导致的分割难题。

Method: 使用18个公共超声数据集，15个用于微调Grounding DINO（采用LoRA适应超声领域），3个用于测试未见分布的性能。

Result: 在多数数据集上优于UniverSeg、MedSAM等方法，且在未见数据集上表现稳定。

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少对大规模器官特定标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习模型在不同脑影像队列中的泛化能力，重点关注年龄和性别这两个关键的神经生物学标记。

Method: 使用三种三维架构（SFCN、DenseNet和Swin Transformers）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI和IXI）中进行年龄和性别预测任务。

Result: SFCN在性别分类任务中表现最佳（AUC 1.00-0.85），在年龄预测任务中误差最低（MAE 2.66-5.81），且统计测试证实其优于Swin Transformer。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑影像分析中优于复杂的注意力架构，表现出更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Motivation: 解决传统文本链式思维（CoT）在处理视觉信息时的语义鸿沟问题，推动AI从静态视觉输入转向动态视觉思维，以更接近人类认知方式。

Conclusion: 论文为多模态AI的未来研究提供了清晰路线图，旨在实现更强大且与人类认知对齐的智能系统。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Result: 在RGB-Thermal、RGB-Depth和RGB-Event等多模态跟踪任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VMDA通过更全面的特征建模和记忆机制，显著提升了多模态跟踪的鲁棒性和判别性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更可解释和鲁棒的AI系统提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个大规模真实世界数据集，用于端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）的个性化研究，并通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和人工验证生成高质量偏好标注，建立了首个个性化E2EAD评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中的个性化研究被忽视，而用户对齐行为对自动驾驶的信任和普及至关重要。缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集阻碍了相关模型的开发与评估。

Method: 从真实道路拓扑中提取静态环境特征，利用微调的VLM推断动态上下文线索，构建一致且细粒度的场景。通过行为分布分析和规则启发式生成客观偏好标注，并利用VLM结合场景语义和驾驶行为生成主观标注，最后通过人工验证融合两者。

Result: 实验表明，结合个性化偏好的模型能生成更符合人类驾驶的行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Conclusion: Zenesis是科学图像分析的高效工具，特别适用于缺乏高质量标注数据的领域。

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

Motivation: 现实环境中数据分布随时间空间变化，传统基于封闭集假设的目标检测器难以适应，需要一种更高效的持续适应方法。

Method: 设计了双路径LoRA域感知适配器分离特征，结合条件扩散参数生成机制，并提出类中心最优传输对齐方法防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中验证了方法的有效性，可视化结果显示生成的参数能更好地捕捉目标信息。

Conclusion: 通过参数生成和特征分离机制，显著提升了目标检测器在动态环境中的适应能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中存在认知偏差，如设计固定性，导致设计空间陷入局部最优。IT-Blender旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和生成噪声图像的潜在表示，并结合混合注意力机制。

Result: IT-Blender在视觉与文本概念混合任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

TL;DR: WaRA是一种基于小波变换的参数高效微调方法，通过多分辨率分析改进LoRA，在视觉和语言任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新的复杂模式。

Method: WaRA利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重建，实现更灵活和稀疏的表示。

Result: WaRA在图像生成、分类和语义分割等任务中表现优越，显著提升生成质量并降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: WaRA不仅适用于视觉任务，在语言任务中也表现出广泛适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

TL;DR: MILo是一种新型高斯泼溅框架，通过可微分地从3D高斯中提取网格，解决了从体积到表面表示的转换问题，实现了高质量、轻量级的3D场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从图像重建3D场景时，提取表面网格需要昂贵的后处理步骤，导致几何细节丢失或生成过于密集的网格。MILo旨在通过直接优化高斯参数，实现体积和表面表示的无缝转换。

Method: MILo设计了完全可微分的过程，通过双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于3D高斯的符号距离计算，直接从高斯参数生成网格。

Result: MILo能够重建完整场景，包括背景，质量达到最新水平，同时所需的网格顶点数量比现有方法少一个数量级。

Conclusion: MILo提供了一种高效、轻量级的3D场景重建方法，适用于物理模拟和动画等下游应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了高质量的数据集和标注模型，推动了多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Motivation: 现有基于视频扩散的世界模型在灵活长度、长时程预测和轨迹规划集成方面存在不足，主要因其依赖固定长度帧序列的全局联合分布建模。

Method: 提出了Epona模型，采用解耦时空因子化和模块化轨迹与视频预测，结合链式前向训练策略以减少自回归循环中的误差积累。

Conclusion: Epona不仅实现了高性能的视频生成，还能作为实时运动规划器，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法因需逐样本训练网络，编码速度过慢，难以实际应用。本文旨在通过组件分析和超网络技术解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了一个库来分析NeRV家族方法的组件，提出了RNeRV配置，并引入超网络预测INR权重以加速编码。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下平均PSNR提升1.27%；超网络技术进一步提升了PSNR和MS-SSIM，同时保持编码速度。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络技术显著提升了视频INR的压缩质量和编码速度，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MetaCipher是一种新型的基于混淆的越狱框架，通过强化学习动态选择加密策略，显著提高了攻击成功率和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）面临日益复杂的混淆攻击，现有防御机制难以应对加密内容。

Method: 提出MetaCipher框架，结合强化学习动态选择最优加密策略，支持多种加密家族。

Result: 在10次查询内，MetaCipher对非推理型LLM的攻击成功率达92%，对推理型LLM达74%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaCipher具有长期鲁棒性和适应性，能有效应对不断升级的安全措施。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to
increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based
attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly
effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret
encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on
keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to
defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or
decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel
obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement
learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses
optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances
jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim
LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,
supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial
strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of
cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,
MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard
malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and
over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing
obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term
robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than
prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式数据管理存在隐私泄露和安全漏洞问题，亟需一种新方法来保护个人数据并增强用户自主权。

Method: 采用去中心化架构，结合安全飞地和联邦学习等隐私增强技术，支持本地计算、模型训练和安全数据共享。

Result: 系统实现了用户对数据的完全控制，同时确保数据可信性和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨行业（如教育、医疗、金融）的个人数据管理提供了高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized
management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security
vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information.
Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail
to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and
unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental
paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal
data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational
credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models,
our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to
selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's
foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure
enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and
data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local
computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while
ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

TL;DR: 该论文对移动应用生态系统中的指纹识别行为进行了大规模分析，发现广告SDK仅占30.56%的指纹行为，而23.92%来自用途不明的SDK，表明仅针对广告领域的反指纹措施效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示移动应用中第三方SDK的指纹识别行为，以评估当前隐私保护措施的有效性。

Method: 研究方法包括从Maven仓库和Google Play商店收集228,000个SDK和178,000个Android应用，并通过静态分析检测500多个信号的外泄。

Result: 结果显示广告SDK仅占指纹行为的30.56%，23.92%来自用途不明的SDK，且信号和API分布稀疏，难以通过用户权限控制。

Conclusion: 结论表明仅针对特定市场领域（如广告）的反指纹措施效果有限，需更全面的政策来应对指纹识别行为。

Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale analysis of fingerprinting-like behavior in
the mobile application ecosystem. We take a market-based approach, focusing on
third-party tracking as enabled by applications' common use of third-party
SDKs. Our dataset consists of over 228,000 SDKs from popular Maven
repositories, 178,000 Android applications collected from the Google Play
store, and our static analysis pipeline detects exfiltration of over 500
individual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the
largest-scale analysis of SDK behavior undertaken to date.
  We find that Ads SDKs (the ostensible focus of industry efforts such as
Apple's App Tracking Transparency and Google's Privacy Sandbox) appear to be
the source of only 30.56% of the fingerprinting behaviors. A surprising 23.92%
originate from SDKs whose purpose was unknown or unclear. Furthermore, Security
and Authentication SDKs are linked to only 11.7% of likely fingerprinting
instances. These results suggest that addressing fingerprinting solely in
specific market-segment contexts like advertising may offer incomplete benefit.
Enforcing anti-fingerprinting policies is also complex, as we observe a sparse
distribution of signals and APIs used by likely fingerprinting SDKs. For
instance, only 2% of exfiltrated APIs are used by more than 75% of SDKs, making
it difficult to rely on user permissions to control fingerprinting behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖遗传算法和手动优化的提示池，无法全面评估模型漏洞，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: VERA将黑盒越狱问题转化为变分推理问题，训练攻击者LLM近似目标LLM的后验分布，生成多样化提示。

Result: 实验表明，VERA在多种目标LLM上表现优异，验证了概率推理在对抗提示生成中的价值。

Conclusion: VERA提供了一种高效且全面的黑盒越狱方法，为模型漏洞评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Result: 提出了解决动态网络环境下防御系统泛化能力不足的方法。

Conclusion: 通用自主网络安全防御（GACD）系统有望提升在动态网络环境中的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本和后门攻击都会影响模型的推理阶段，因此需要一种统一的在线检测方法来解决这两种威胁。

Method: UniGuard通过分析输入在模型传播中的轨迹差异，将其视为时间序列信号，使用LSTM和频谱变换来检测细微的异常。

Result: UniGuard在多种模态（图像、文本、音频）和任务（分类、回归）中表现出色，优于现有针对单一威胁的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: UniGuard是首个能同时高效检测对抗样本和后门攻击的统一框架，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

Motivation: 现有方法在保护图神经网络隐私时，隐私成本随层数线性增长，导致需要过多噪声，影响模型性能。本文旨在通过理论分析和新技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出收缩图层（CGL），利用标准GNN操作的收缩性质，结合隐私放大技术，设计CARIBOU框架，包含收缩聚合模块、隐私分配模块和隐私审计模块。

Result: 实验表明，CARIBOU显著改善了隐私与效用的权衡，并在隐私审计任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和新技术，CARIBOU成功解决了GNNs中隐私预算随层数增长的问题，为隐私保护提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has been integrated into graph neural networks
(GNNs) to protect sensitive structural information, e.g., edges, nodes, and
associated features across various applications. A common approach is to
perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN
architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that
grows linearly with the number of layers (Usenix Security'23), ultimately
requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This
limitation becomes particularly problematic when deep GNNs are necessary to
capture complex and long-range interactions in graphs. In this paper, we
theoretically establish that the privacy budget can converge with respect to
the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the
message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to
standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet
effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness
required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our
framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a
contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy
auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU
significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior
performance in privacy auditing tasks.

Result: 该方法比传统基于特征的方法在恶意软件检测上具有更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和RAG的静态分析方法能有效提升恶意软件检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The widespread use of Android applications has made them a prime target for
cyberattacks, significantly increasing the risk of malware that threatens user
privacy, security, and device functionality. Effective malware detection is
thus critical, with static analysis, dynamic analysis, and Machine Learning
being widely used approaches. In this work, we focus on a Machine
Learning-based method utilizing static features. We first compiled a dataset of
benign and malicious APKs and performed static analysis to extract features
such as code structure, permissions, and manifest file content, without
executing the apps. Instead of relying solely on raw static features, our
system uses an LLM to generate high-level functional descriptions of APKs. To
mitigate hallucinations, which are a known vulnerability of LLM, we integrated
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling the LLM to ground its output in
relevant context. Using carefully designed prompts, we guide the LLM to produce
coherent function summaries, which are then analyzed using a transformer-based
model, improving detection accuracy over conventional feature-based methods for
malware detection.

Motivation: 现有隐私框架（如情境完整性）难以捕捉或分类现代技术使用个人数据带来的多种危害，因此需要新的概念化方法。

Method: 通过一项包含400名大学生的在线研究，参与者评估了人工智能算法推断个人数据（如人口统计、人格特征等）可能导致的14种危害。

Conclusion: 研究不仅深化了对隐私概念的理解，还为教育和就业领域的隐私改进提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We propose a harm-centric conceptualization of privacy that asks: What harms
from personal data use can privacy prevent? The motivation behind this research
is limitations in existing privacy frameworks (e.g., Contextual Integrity) to
capture or categorize many of the harms that arise from modern technology's use
of personal data. We operationalize this conceptualization in an online study
with 400 college and university students. Study participants indicated their
perceptions of different harms (e.g., manipulation, discrimination, and
harassment) that may arise when artificial intelligence-based algorithms infer
personal data (e.g., demographics, personality traits, and cognitive
disability) and use it to identify students who are likely to drop out of a
course or the best job candidate. The study includes 14 harms and six types of
personal data selected based on an extensive literature review.
  Comprehensive statistical analyses of the study data show that the 14 harms
are internally consistent and collectively represent a general notion of
privacy harms. The study data also surfaces nuanced perceptions of harms, both
across the contexts and participants' demographic factors. Based on these
results, we discuss how privacy can be improved equitably. Thus, this research
not only contributes to enhancing the understanding of privacy as a concept but
also provides practical guidance to improve privacy in the context of education
and employment.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital
information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities
of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on
alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding
models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant
data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard
against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data
which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security
assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for
processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we
suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by
invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using
usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the
uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to
a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper
proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential
reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process
and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To
estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like,
recall, F1 score and accuracy.

improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In
this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting
DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and
shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.
The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection

Motivation: 在机器学习安全中，高维向量中的异常值会污染平均值计算，影响模型训练。现有的鲁棒聚合方法需要先验知识或计算阈值，不够实用。

Method: 设计了一种准线性时间运行的鲁棒聚合算法，无需预先了解干净向量的分布或计算过滤阈值。

Result: 算法在实验中表现出高效运行时间，并能有效抵御10种不同的ML中毒攻击。

Conclusion: 该算法为机器学习训练提供了一种实用且高效的防御策略。

Abstract: In machine learning security, one is often faced with the problem of removing
outliers from a given set of high-dimensional vectors when computing their
average. For example, many variants of data poisoning attacks produce gradient
vectors during training that are outliers in the distribution of clean
gradients, which bias the computed average used to derive the ML model.
Filtering them out before averaging serves as a generic defense strategy.
Byzantine robust aggregation is an algorithmic primitive which computes a
robust average of vectors, in the presence of an $\epsilon$ fraction of vectors
which may have been arbitrarily and adaptively corrupted, such that the
resulting bias in the final average is provably bounded.
  In this paper, we give the first robust aggregator that runs in quasi-linear
time in the size of input vectors and provably has near-optimal bias bounds.
Our algorithm also does not assume any knowledge of the distribution of clean
vectors, nor does it require pre-computing any filtering thresholds from it.
This makes it practical to use directly in standard neural network training
procedures. We empirically confirm its expected runtime efficiency and its
effectiveness in nullifying 10 different ML poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM-agent生态系统的快速发展，插件、连接器和协议激增，但发现机制和安全实践未能跟上，导致集成脆弱性增加。

Method: 通过统一威胁模型，分类四大攻击领域，分析代表性攻击场景、现实可行性和现有防御措施。

Result: 提出了三十多种攻击技术，评估了防御措施，并识别了未来研究方向，如动态信任管理和加密溯源。

Conclusion: 论文为设计稳健防御机制和建立LLM-agent工作流程的最佳实践提供了全面参考。

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在央行数字货币（CBDC）中使用阈值签名方案（TSS）以增强安全性，同时保持可接受的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBDC依赖数字签名确保交易真实性，但私钥泄露风险高，因此需要更安全的分布式签名方案。

Method: 研究基于ECDSA的TSS及其库，分析CBDC特定需求，并以Filia CBDC为基础进行详细评估。

Result: 性能评估显示TSS能提升CBDC安全性，同时满足实际部署的性能要求。

Conclusion: TSS是增强CBDC安全性的可行方案，且性能可接受。

Abstract: Digital signatures are crucial for securing Central Bank Digital Currencies
(CBDCs) transactions. Like most forms of digital currencies, CBDC solutions
rely on signatures for transaction authenticity and integrity, leading to major
issues in the case of private key compromise. Our work explores threshold
signature schemes (TSSs) in the context of CBDCs. TSSs allow distributed key
management and signing, reducing the risk of a compromised key. We analyze
CBDC-specific requirements, considering the applicability of TSSs, and use
Filia CBDC solution as a base for a detailed evaluation. As most of the current
solutions rely on ECDSA for compatibility, we focus on ECDSA-based TSSs and
their supporting libraries. Our performance evaluation measured the
computational and communication complexity across key processes, as well as the
throughput and latency of end-to-end transactions. The results confirm that TSS
can enhance the security of CBDC implementations while maintaining acceptable
performance for real-world deployments.

TL;DR: MH-AutoML是一个针对Android恶意软件检测的领域专用AutoML框架，通过自动化整个ML流程并提供透明性和可解释性，优于现有AutoML解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML解决方案在透明性、可解释性和实验可追溯性方面存在不足，限制了其在网络安全领域的应用。

Method: MH-AutoML自动化了数据预处理、特征工程、算法选择和超参数调优，并集成了可解释性、调试和实验跟踪功能。

Result: 与七种主流AutoML框架相比，MH-AutoML在召回率上表现更优，同时提供更高的透明性和控制力，计算效率相当。

Conclusion: MH-AutoML在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色，适用于网络安全应用。

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

Result: 揭示了验证实时交互式人类输入的困难，以及签名方案、游戏完整性和可证明游戏的局限性。

Conclusion: 验证速通记录的真实性在不可信环境中极具挑战性，现有密码学方法存在局限性。

Abstract: Speedrunning is a competition that emerged from communities of early video
games such as Doom (1993). Speedrunners try to finish a game in minimal time.
Provably verifying the authenticity of submitted speedruns is an open problem.
Traditionally, best-effort speedrun verification is conducted by on-site human
observers, forensic audio analysis, or a rigorous mathematical analysis of the
game mechanics. Such methods are tedious, fallible, and, perhaps worst of all,
not cryptographic. Motivated by naivety and the Dunning-Kruger effect, we
attempt to build a system that cryptographically proves the authenticity of
speedruns. This paper describes our attempted solutions and ways to circumvent
them. Through a narration of our failures, we attempt to demonstrate the
difficulty of authenticating live and interactive human input in untrusted
environments, as well as the limits of signature schemes, game integrity, and
provable play.

Result: MCPCorpus提供了MCP生态系统的可重现快照，支持对采用趋势、生态系统健康和实现多样性的研究。

Conclusion: MCPCorpus填补了MCP生态系统研究的空白，并提供了实用工具和界面以支持高效探索。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently emerged as a standardized
interface for connecting language models with external tools and data. As the
ecosystem rapidly expands, the lack of a structured, comprehensive view of
existing MCP artifacts presents challenges for research. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MCPCorpus, a large-scale dataset containing around 14K MCP servers
and 300 MCP clients. Each artifact is annotated with 20+ normalized attributes
capturing its identity, interface configuration, GitHub activity, and metadata.
MCPCorpus provides a reproducible snapshot of the real-world MCP ecosystem,
enabling studies of adoption trends, ecosystem health, and implementation
diversity. To keep pace with the rapid evolution of the MCP ecosystem, we
provide utility tools for automated data synchronization, normalization, and
inspection. Furthermore, to support efficient exploration and exploitation, we
release a lightweight web-based search interface. MCPCorpus is publicly
available at: https://github.com/Snakinya/MCPCorpus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的安全聚合虽然保护了客户隐私，但也增加了检测恶意行为和评估客户贡献的难度。QI和FedGT分别解决了部分问题，但各自存在不足。

Method: 结合QI和FedGT的方法，以同时实现恶意行为检测和贡献评估。

Result: 实验表明，结合方法比单独使用QI或FedGT表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过整合QI和FedGT的优势，可以更有效地解决联邦学习中的恶意行为检测和贡献评估问题。

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative
learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information.
However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client
behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the
learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et
al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection
(MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance
on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks
the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to
achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to using either method independently.

Motivation: 解决行业中对AI能力的误解，明确区分自动化与自主性，以避免因误用工具而增加安全风险。

Method: 借鉴机器人学原则，建立了一个6级分类法（0-5级），用于区分网络安全AI的自动化与自主性。

Result: 当前‘自主’渗透测试工具仅达到3-4级，仍需人类监督；真正的5级自主性尚未实现。

Conclusion: 需采用精确术语、透明披露能力，并强调人机合作而非替代，以避免潜在风险。

Abstract: The cybersecurity industry combines "automated" and "autonomous" AI, creating
dangerous misconceptions about system capabilities. Recent milestones like XBOW
topping HackerOne's leaderboard showcase impressive progress, yet these systems
remain fundamentally semi-autonomous--requiring human oversight. Drawing from
robotics principles, where the distinction between automation and autonomy is
well-established, I take inspiration from prior work and establish a 6-level
taxonomy (Level 0-5) distinguishing automation from autonomy in Cybersecurity
AI. Current "autonomous" pentesters operate at Level 3-4: they execute complex
attack sequences but need human review for edge cases and strategic decisions.
True Level 5 autonomy remains aspirational. Organizations deploying
mischaracterized "autonomous" tools risk reducing oversight precisely when it's
most needed, potentially creating new vulnerabilities. The path forward
requires precise terminology, transparent capabilities disclosure, and human-AI
partnership-not replacement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在敏感领域的广泛应用，传统隐私保护措施无法有效应对隐含、上下文或可推断的语义隐私风险。

Method: 通过生命周期框架分析LLMs在输入处理、预训练、微调和对齐阶段的语义隐私风险，并评估现有防御措施的效果。

Result: 研究发现当前防御措施在语义层面存在显著漏洞，尤其是针对上下文推断和潜在表示泄露。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决语义泄露量化、多模态输入保护、去标识化与生成质量的平衡，以及隐私执行的透明度等挑战。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Result: 方案在理论和实验上均证明了其安全性和效率，同时提高了训练速度并减少了通信开销。

Conclusion: PBFL方案有效解决了隐私泄露和模型投毒攻击问题，适用于非独立同分布数据集场景。

Abstract: The privacy-preserving federated learning schemes based on the setting of two
honest-but-curious and non-colluding servers offer promising solutions in terms
of security and efficiency. However, our investigation reveals that these
schemes still suffer from privacy leakage when considering model poisoning
attacks from malicious users. Specifically, we demonstrate that the
privacy-preserving computation process for defending against model poisoning
attacks inadvertently leaks privacy to one of the honest-but-curious servers,
enabling it to access users' gradients in plaintext. To address both privacy
leakage and model poisoning attacks, we propose an enhanced privacy-preserving
and Byzantine-robust federated learning (PBFL) scheme, comprising three
components: (1) a two-trapdoor fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme to
bolster users' privacy protection; (2) a novel secure normalization judgment
method to preemptively thwart gradient poisoning; and (3) an innovative secure
cosine similarity measurement method for detecting model poisoning attacks
without compromising data privacy. Our scheme guarantees privacy preservation
and resilience against model poisoning attacks, even in scenarios with
heterogeneous, non-IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) datasets.
Theoretical analyses substantiate the security and efficiency of our scheme,
and extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of our private attacks.
Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme accelerates
training speed while reducing communication overhead compared to the
state-of-the-art PBFL schemes.

Motivation: MBA混淆被恶意软件利用，传统方法忽视内部语义信息，需改进。

Method: 构建真值表作为语义表示，并设计基于Transformer的Seq2Seq框架gMBA。

Result: 实验表明，语义指导显著提升反混淆性能。

Conclusion: 内部语义信息对恢复原始代码至关重要。

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

CHERI also rewrites some of the assumptions about how C works and how
fundamental types (such as pointers) are implemented in hardware. We conducted
a usability study to examine how developers react to the changes required by

Abstract: There are many sandboxing mechanisms provided by operating systems to limit
what resources applications can access, however, sometimes the use of these

challenging to apply to certain types of applications, and propose Threadbox, a
sandboxing mechanism that enables having modular and independent sandboxes, and
can be applied to threads and sandbox specific functions. We present case
studies to illustrate the applicability of the idea and discuss its

Abstract: Several recent works focused on the best practices for applying machine
learning to cybersecurity. In the context of malware, TESSERACT highlighted the
impact of concept drift on detection performance and suggested temporal and
spatial constraints to be enforced to ensure realistic time-aware evaluations,
which have been adopted by the community. In this paper, we demonstrate
striking discrepancies in the performance of learning-based malware detection
across the same time frame when evaluated on two representative Android malware
datasets used in top-tier security conferences, both adhering to established
sampling and evaluation guidelines. This questions our ability to understand
how current state-of-the-art approaches would perform in realistic scenarios.
To address this, we identify five novel temporal and spatial bias factors that
affect realistic evaluations. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of these
factors in the Android malware domain on two representative datasets and five
Android malware classifiers used or proposed in top-tier security conferences.
For each factor, we provide practical and actionable recommendations that the
community should integrate in their methodology for more realistic and
reproducible settings.

Conclusion: 论文为通过更广泛的风险管理建模方法解决这些问题提供了方向。

Abstract: Attack Trees (AT) are a popular formalism for security analysis. They are
meant to display an attacker's goal decomposed into attack steps needed to
achieve it and compute certain security metrics (e.g., attack cost,
probability, and damage). ATs offer three important services: (a) conceptual
modeling capabilities for representing security risk management scenarios, (b)
a qualitative assessment to find root causes and minimal conditions of
successful attacks, and (c) quantitative analyses via security metrics
computation under formal semantics, such as minimal time and cost among all
attacks. Still, the AT language presents limitations due to its lack of
ontological foundations, thus compromising associated services. Via an
ontological analysis grounded in the Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER)
-- a reference core ontology based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)
-- we investigate the ontological adequacy of AT and reveal four significant
shortcomings: (1) ambiguous syntactical terms that can be interpreted in
various ways; (2) ontological deficit concerning crucial domain-specific
concepts; (3) lacking modeling guidance to construct ATs decomposing a goal;
(4) lack of semantic interoperability, resulting in ad hoc stand-alone tools.
We also discuss existing incremental solutions and how our analysis paves the
way for overcoming those issues through a broader approach to risk management
modeling.

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intersection of privacy, security, and
environmental sustainability in cloud-based office solutions, focusing on
quantifying user- and network-side energy use and associated carbon emissions.
We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more
energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To
evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures
environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during
well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first
analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation
through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of
these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software
environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream
email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from
ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft
Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a
self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption.
We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15%
of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient,
saving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial
providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per
session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2%
through ad-blocking.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的恶意软件分类方法，通过构建包含类型和家族标签的新数据集，并使用静态分析提取特征，实现了高精度的分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶意软件分类的挑战，通过多级标签（类型和家族）提供更细粒度的分类能力。

Method: 收集并标注恶意软件样本，使用静态分析提取特征，采用随机森林和XGBoost等模型进行分类任务。

Result: 在二进制分类任务中，模型准确率高达98.98%；在有限数据条件下仍表现优异；多类分类任务中，SVM和随机森林分别达到81.1%和73.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 多级标签支持更精细的恶意软件分类，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of malware classification using machine
learning by developing a novel dataset labeled at both the malware type and
family levels. Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX
Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family
information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from
ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was
processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,
particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support
advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key
classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign
samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,
reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.
When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under
limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%
for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass
classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the
models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on
family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns
samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type
labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family
labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and
computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family
levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The
work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware
detection and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代企业数据库系统在平衡数据安全性和性能方面面临挑战，现有加密方法需要停机时间和额外存储。

Method: 利用深度学习方法（如Transformer和LSTM）预测数据库锁序列，使用IBM Db2和TPC-C基准数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 提出的模型在表级和页级预测中分别达到49%和66%的平均准确率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现在线加密提供了可行路径，有助于构建安全且低开销的数据库系统。

Abstract: Modern enterprise database systems face significant challenges in balancing
data security and performance. Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive
information is critical for systems' compliance with security standards.
Although holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing
database systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting
in prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to
implement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without
disrupting critical operations.
  To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online
database encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for
downtime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this
vision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed
next, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this
solution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep
learning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the
database system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset
from TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training
and evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and
LSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock
predictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive
Baseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.
  The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based
models achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for
page-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline. By anticipating which
tables and pages will be locked next, the proposed approach is a step toward
online encryption, offering a practical path toward secure, low-overhead
database systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了针对本地差分隐私（LDP）的新型投毒攻击方法，并提出了相应的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地差分隐私（LDP）虽能保护用户隐私，但易受投毒攻击影响，尤其是排名估计任务。

Method: 针对kRR、OUE和OLH协议，提出了基于攻击成本和最优攻击项（集）的策略，并设计了谐波成本函数和基于置信度的攻击策略。

Result: 理论和实验证明了攻击的有效性，强调了防御的必要性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LDP在排名估计中的投毒漏洞，并提出了解决方案，为防御提供了方向。

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) involves users perturbing their inputs to
provide plausible deniability of their data. However, this also makes LDP
vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In this paper, we first introduce novel
poisoning attacks for ranking estimation. These attacks are intricate, as fake
attackers do not merely adjust the frequency of target items. Instead, they
leverage a limited number of fake users to precisely modify frequencies,
effectively altering item rankings to maximize gains. To tackle this challenge,
we introduce the concepts of attack cost and optimal attack item (set), and
propose corresponding strategies for kRR, OUE, and OLH protocols. For kRR, we
iteratively select optimal attack items and allocate suitable fake users. For
OUE, we iteratively determine optimal attack item sets and consider the
incremental changes in item frequencies across different sets. Regarding OLH,
we develop a harmonic cost function based on the pre-image of a hash to select
that supporting a larger number of effective attack items. Lastly, we present
an attack strategy based on confidence levels to quantify the probability of a
successful attack and the number of attack iterations more precisely. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks through theoretical and empirical
evidence, highlighting the necessity for defenses against these attacks. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速越狱框架logit-gap steering，通过单次词汇表遍历减少RLHF对齐语言模型的拒绝-确认差距，高效且通用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有越狱方法效率低、通用性差的问题，同时探索安全调整对模型内部表示的影响。

Method: 利用前向可计算分数结合KL惩罚和奖励偏移的轻量级代理，通过“排序-求和-停止”快速生成短后缀。

Result: 在0.5B至70B模型中，单次攻击成功率提升至80-100%，且保持主题连贯性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，揭示了安全调整对模型内部表示的影响，为对齐研究提供了轻量级工具。

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统（ITS）依赖高质量时空交通数据，但实际数据常因通信故障或传感器故障而缺失或损坏，现有张量潜在分解模型（LFT）对异常值敏感。

Method: 提出TDWLFT模型，采用阈值距离加权损失函数，通过为不同样本分配差异化权重，降低模型对异常值的敏感性。

Result: 在两个不同城市环境的交通速度数据集上的实验表明，TDWLFT模型在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TDWLFT模型有效解决了LFT模型对异常值敏感的问题，提升了交通数据缺失填补的性能。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: RL-Net在准确性、可解释性和用户适应性上表现优越，同时减少了规则复杂性。

Conclusion: RL-Net是透明性与性能之间的实用折中方案，展示了神经符号模型在手势识别中的可行性，并为可解释AI在边缘传感系统中的应用提供了见解。

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有望改善SARS-CoV-2患者的护理和决策，为医疗系统提供更有效的支持。

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced
progression of PASC. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available
cohort of 18 PASC patients, with text time series features based on Large
Language Model Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical risk annotated by clinical
expert. We propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and

with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络物理系统（CPS）在多个关键领域扮演重要角色，但其日益增长的连接性使其易受复杂网络攻击，传统安全方法对此无效。

Method: HAMARL采用分层结构，包括专注于子系统安全的本地智能体和全局协调器，并结合对抗训练循环以模拟和预测威胁。

Result: 实验表明，HAMARL显著提高了攻击检测准确性，缩短了响应时间，并确保了系统连续性。

Conclusion: 分层多智能体协调与对抗训练的结合有效提升了下一代CPS的弹性和安全性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态融合、计算需求和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: EAGLE采用动态跨模态注意力机制、高维降维、三种互补归因方法和统一管道，适用于多种癌症类型。

Result: 在911名患者中验证，EAGLE能有效识别高风险患者，生存期差异显著（4-5倍），并提升临床决策的可信度。

Conclusion: EAGLE结合高性能与可解释性，为多模态生存预测提供了可扩展的解决方案，增强了临床应用的可行性。

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候模型（GCMs）分辨率低，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高且灵活性有限。深度学习虽高效，但现有研究多关注单变量模型，缺乏跨变量交互。

Method: 使用共享编码器和变量特定解码器的ViT架构，联合预测表面温度、风速和500 hPa位势高度。

Result: 多变量方法实现了跨变量知识转移，性能优于单变量基线，并提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多变量建模在高分辨率气候降尺度中具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

successfully improves stability in terms of the temperature control by about 3
times compared to ordinary solvers.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Result: MIO解决了DPO后期性能下降问题，在推理和数学任务中表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: MIO为模型对齐提供了新视角，并在性能上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Result: 框架在开源工具箱SMT 2.0中实现，并通过绿色飞机架构案例验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂系统设计提供了高效的建模和优化方法。

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Conclusion: H-VAW-D算法在非参数域中实现了动态遗憾的最优性能，具有高效的计算复杂度。

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator
sequence.

Motivation: 探讨后训练方法（如指令调优、强化学习或知识蒸馏）是否通过改变Transformer层结构来提升数学推理能力。

Method: 通过层级消融实验，分析不同后训练变体在数学推理任务中的表现。

Result: 数学推理任务依赖特定层结构，移除这些层会导致准确性大幅下降；而非数学任务则无此现象。

Conclusion: 数学推理需要预训练中形成的专用层，而其他任务则不需要。

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering
applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods
rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning

Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多尺度系统的计算效率和预测准确性。

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Result: DistShap在准确性上优于现有方法，并能扩展到百万级特征的GNN模型，支持128个GPU并行计算。

Conclusion: DistShap为大规模GNN解释提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Conclusion: 通过调整嵌入的方向和大小，有效缓解了语义坍缩问题，提升了生成个性化任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Transformer中残差流的信息存储和检索机制，以提升性能和效率。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替代传统Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在相同损失下减少58% FLOPS、25%参数和41%训练token，且在下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RMT通过更高效的残差流扩展和方差传播特性，显著提升了Transformer的性能和效率。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

Motivation: 现有P2P交易方法缺乏确保公平性的稳健框架，FairMarket-RL旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 代理在模拟P2P微电网中表现优异，满足90%以上买方需求，公平性评分高于0.80。

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL为去中心化能源系统提供了一种可扩展、公平驱动的自主交易解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Conclusion: 揭示了损失景观的更深层次结构，强调了对称性分析对理解模型空间几何的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

Result: 在真实数据集上，BEST-Route节省60%成本，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route有效平衡了成本与性能，为LLM部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the
influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

TL;DR: xLSTMAD是一种基于xLSTM架构的异常检测方法，首次将xLSTM应用于多变量时间序列数据的异常检测，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管xLSTM在时间序列预测等领域表现出色，但尚未用于异常检测，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出xLSTMAD，包含编码器和两种解码器变体（预测和重建），并测试了MSE和SoftDTW两种损失函数。

Result: 在TSB-AD-M基准测试中，xLSTMAD优于23种基线方法，展示了xLSTM在异常检测中的强大能力。

Conclusion: xLSTMAD为异常检测提供了新思路，展示了xLSTM在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine
learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Conclusion: SLE及其自动学习方法在可扩展的BN结构学习中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Result: 在多种模型架构和数据集上验证，P$^2$U在准确性、带宽和延迟之间取得更好权衡，支持激进量化（如4位）而不显著影响性能。

Conclusion: P$^2$U是低资源环境（如联邦学习、边缘计算和物联网）中高效模型分发的实用解决方案，可与现有压缩技术互补。

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

Conclusion: 该模型在保持高效的同时增强了可解释性，适用于大规模时间序列数据分析，并能揭示复杂的时空模式。

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Result: 在三个多组学癌症分类数据集上，MAGNET优于现有融合方法。

Conclusion: MAGNET通过高效融合和适应性图结构，显著提升了缺失模态数据的预测性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

Result: 微采样组减少峰值内存使用50%以上，Infinite Sampling提升吞吐量25%，保持完整性和内存效率。

Conclusion: Infinite Sampling在有限GPU内存下实现高效稳定的GRPO训练，支持更大组规模。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly

Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is
proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in
high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing
methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters
that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a
projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions
to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types.
This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our
empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming

decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a
promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,

Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust

Conclusion: BWLer结合了PINNs的灵活性和经典谱求解器的精度，为PDE求解提供实用路径。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

TL;DR: Forget-MI是一种新型的机器学习遗忘方法，专注于多模态医疗数据，通过损失函数和扰动技术实现数据遗忘，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗AI中，隐私保护至关重要，但现有方法难以从多模态模型中完全移除敏感患者数据。

Method: 提出Forget-MI方法，通过设计损失函数和扰动技术，遗忘特定数据的单模态和联合表示，同时保留其他数据的知识。

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上的性能显著降低（AUC和F1分数分别下降0.221和0.305），同时测试集性能与原始模型相当，且减少了0.202的成员推理攻击（MIA）风险。

Conclusion: Forget-MI在多模态医疗数据遗忘中表现出色，平衡了隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Result: TriLMs在1.2万亿token上训练表现良好，TriRun推理速度比浮点基线快5倍。

Conclusion: 为高效LLMs的构建和部署奠定基础，提供研究社区资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Conclusion: Transformer模型通过专用计算电路学习模算术，为更可解释和高效的神经网络方法铺平道路。

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

Result: 平均偏差减少43.35%，MSE显著降低，性能优于SMOTE过采样。

Conclusion: 特征混合框架高效且无需显式识别偏差属性，未来可应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Result: 在Mujoco连续控制环境中验证了抗脆弱参数的存在，这些参数在压力下能提升策略性能。

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒和抗脆弱的强化学习系统提供了基础，展示了目标过滤技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了知识蒸馏的效果，特别是在小数据集或不平衡数据集上。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Result: 在多个评估场景中表现最佳，推理时间减少50%-30%，CRPS提升3%-12%。

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion通过结合物理原理和随机性，显著提升了空气质量预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score
(CRPS).

Result: GPT-4的分类准确率为66.2%，显著高于GPT-3.5（55.9%）和BERT（48.1%），且其语义相似性与人类反应的相关性较高。

Conclusion: 现代大型语言模型能够以可测量的准确性近似人类心理概念，为开发更可解释的AI系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

Motivation: 现实环境中因果机制常因观察窗口狭窄而看似漂移，导致世界模型构建时难以捕捉动态变化。

Method: 引入Meta-Causal Graph作为统一表示，包含多个由元状态触发的因果子图；设计Causality-Seeking Agent通过好奇心驱动策略识别元状态和因果关系。

Result: 在合成任务和机器人操作任务中，方法能有效捕捉因果动态变化并泛化到新场景。

Conclusion: Meta-Causal Graph和Causality-Seeking Agent为动态因果机制建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

Conclusion: 镜像下降策略优化在鲁棒性测试中显著优于基线算法，为约束条件下的强化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

Conclusion: SynCheck通过量化与优化合成数据质量，有效解决了无线传感任务中合成数据利用的局限性，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code
are publicly available at

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

*Bálint Horváth,Balázs Csanád Csáji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统计学习方法，用于估计图像缺失像素，同时提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像修复和超分辨率问题中的像素估计需求，并量化估计的不确定性。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）的假设，提出了一种名为SGKI的方法，扩展了现有核方法，并利用Schur补高效计算置信带。

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素构建非渐近置信带，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SGKI是一种高效且可靠的方法，适用于图像修复和超分辨率任务。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的Masked Gated Linear Units (MGLUs)，通过共享权重矩阵和二进制掩码减少内存读取，并设计了高效内核FlashMGLU，显著提升了推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GLUs因使用独立权重矩阵导致的内存读取效率低下问题。

Method: 提出MGLUs，包括MoEG架构（共享权重矩阵和二进制掩码）和FlashMGLU内核。

Result: FlashMGLU在RTX5090 GPU上比标准GLUs快34%，内存效率高47%；SwiMGLU在保持内存优势的同时，性能优于SwiGLU。

Conclusion: MGLUs在减少内存传输的同时，保持了或超越了传统GLUs的性能。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型因参数规模庞大导致的内存、存储和部署挑战，以及现有专家合并方法因专家专业化导致的参数冲突问题。

Method: 采用子空间专家合并框架，包括自适应专家聚类和子空间专家合并两个阶段，通过SVD提取共享U矩阵并合并专家特定V矩阵。

Result: 在多个MoE LLM上显著优于现有方法，Mixtral-8x7B在减少25%|50%专家时保持96%|86%原始性能。

Conclusion: Sub-MoE通过子空间对齐和融合专家，有效解决了参数冲突问题，为MoE模型的压缩和优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

Motivation: 随着推理模型在复杂任务中的应用增加，用户对模型推理时间的不确定性感到挫败，需要一种方法来预测和显示推理进度。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但讨论了方法的可行性和对用户体验的潜在影响。

Conclusion: 本文为推理模型的时间预测提供了研究方向，并探讨了其对用户交互和未来研究的启示。

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（BAPE），通过显式建模后验概率参数并直接学习贝叶斯分类器，解决了长尾数据分布中的梯度不平衡问题，同时确保贝叶斯最优决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习算法通过隐式估计后验概率（如最小化Softmax交叉熵损失）在长尾数据分布中表现不佳，导致梯度不平衡和无法确保贝叶斯最优决策。

Method: BAPE方法显式建模后验概率参数，通过点估计直接学习贝叶斯分类器，避免基于梯度下降的优化，并提出分布调整技术以适应任意不平衡的测试数据分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、CIFAR-100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist等数据集上，BAPE显著提升了深度网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: BAPE方法通过显式建模后验概率和分布调整技术，有效解决了长尾数据分布中的问题，且与现有方法正交，具有简单高效的特点。

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，深度学习研究中对反直觉现象的解释往往孤立且缺乏实际应用证据，作者认为这种研究方式效率低下。

Method: 通过分析文献中的典型案例，重新评估研究这些现象的方法和社区规范。

Result: 研究发现这些现象在现实应用中证据不足，但可作为验证通用理论的独特场景。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究应更注重与深度学习整体目标的结合，避免孤立解释现象。

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Motivation: 传统方法在计算成本、性能和稳定性方面存在局限，而现有VAE方法需要分支专用模块，限制了其稳定性和深度层次关系捕捉能力。

Result: HDTree在通用和单细胞数据集上表现优于现有方法，提高了准确性和性能。

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，能更准确高效地建模细胞分化路径，支持下游生物任务。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

Motivation: 研究数据估值方法在数据市场中的公平性和稳定性，揭示其技术及伦理问题。

Method: 分析了9个表格分类数据集和6种数据估值方法，探讨预处理技术、子采样和少数群体数据估值的影响。

Result: 发现数据估值易受预处理影响，可能加剧类别不平衡，并低估少数群体数据价值。

Conclusion: 提出DValCards框架以提高数据估值透明度，减少误用，促进可信的机器学习系统。

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

Motivation: 传统加性噪声模型（ANM）在存在未观测中介变量时失效，且现有解决方案在有限样本下表现不稳定，因此需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出BiDD方法，利用去噪扩散过程中的独立性检验统计量，通过条件噪声预测评估因果方向性。

Conclusion: BiDD为双变量因果发现提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在未观测中介变量存在时表现优异。

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与模块化逻辑推理能够提升系统可靠性和可解释性，为复杂领域提供可信赖的AI代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算科学中基准数据集的稀缺性，评估新方法变得困难。BenchMake旨在解决这一问题，将开放的科学数据集转化为基准测试集。

Method: 使用非负矩阵分解确定边缘案例，并在凸包上划分测试集，以最大化差异和统计显著性。

Result: 在十个公开的科学数据集上测试，BenchMake的分割方法优于现有方法和随机分割。

Conclusion: BenchMake为计算科学提供了一种有效的基准测试生成工具，适用于多种数据类型。

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常表现出非平稳性，这会降低预训练预测模型的性能。现有的测试时适应方法通常更新整个模型，增加了内存和计算成本。

Method: PETSA使用低秩适配器和动态门控调整表示，无需重新训练。通过结合鲁棒项、频域项和结构对齐项的专用损失函数，保持准确性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，PETSA在所有时间范围内均达到竞争性或更好的性能。

Conclusion: PETSA提高了各种预测主干的适应性，同时需要的参数少于基线方法。

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%
accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low
false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

Conclusion: TripleAD通过三通道协作和互蒸馏策略，显著提升了图异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

TL;DR: SMART是一种轻量级、数据高效的校准方法，通过基于logit间隙的精确调整和软分箱目标，解决了神经网络校准中的偏差和方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络存在系统性过度自信问题，现有校准方法在全局调整和局部表达性之间存在偏差与方差的权衡。

Method: SMART利用logit间隙作为去噪信号，结合软分箱的Expected Calibration Error目标，实现高效校准。

Result: SMART在多种数据集和架构上表现出色，参数更少且校准性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测中的不确定性量化提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Result: FedWSQ显著降低通信开销并保持高模型精度，在极端数据异构和低比特通信场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FedWSQ在多种挑战性联邦学习场景中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Motivation: 动量方法在深度神经网络等随机非凸优化中的理论依据不足，QHM作为通用算法被研究以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过渐近和非渐近收敛分析，研究了批量大小增加的QHM算法，比较了学习率衰减与批量增加的效果。

Result: 增加批量大小而非降低学习率能更有效地实现收敛，实验证明批量有限增加对神经网络训练有益。

Conclusion: QHM算法通过增加批量大小提供了一种更优的训练策略，适用于随机非凸优化问题。

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

Result: 结果表明，该框架适用于多种注意力机制（如基于核和稀疏注意力），并推广了先前的工作或覆盖了未涉及的架构。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为设计具有UAP保证的新型Transformer架构提供了理论基础，并展示了具体示例。

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Transition Matching (TM)的新生成范式，统一并改进了扩散/流模型和连续自回归生成方法。通过三种TM变体，展示了其在图像质量和文本一致性上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型的设计空间已较为成熟，改进空间有限；同时，连续自回归模型在统一文本和媒体生成方面展现出潜力。因此，需要一种新方法来结合两者的优势并推动进一步创新。

Method: TM将复杂生成任务分解为简单的马尔可夫转移，支持非确定性概率转移核和任意非连续监督过程。提出了三种TM变体：DTM（推广流匹配）、ARTM和FHTM（推广连续自回归方法）。

Result: DTM在图像质量和文本一致性上达到最优，采样效率更高；ARTM和FHTM在连续因果自回归生成中表现优异，FHTM首次在文本到图像任务中超越流方法。

Conclusion: TM为生成模型提供了新的灵活设计空间，通过三种变体展示了其在性能和效率上的优势，为统一文本和媒体生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测未来异常事件（AP任务）上表现不足，无法提供精确预测，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: A2P框架由Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF)和Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP)组成，AAF学习异常关系，SAP通过Anomaly Prompt Pool模拟多样异常模式。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，A2P优于现有方法，能够有效预测未来异常。

Conclusion: A2P框架为解决AP任务提供了一种有效方法，展示了预测未来异常的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

Motivation: 水质数据的完整性对科学决策和生态保护至关重要，但传统填补方法难以捕捉数据的潜在动态和深层特征。

Result: 在三个真实水质数据集上的实验表明，该模型在估计精度上显著优于现有最先进的数据填补模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为复杂动态环境中的水质监测数据处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete

using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

Conclusion: WATS通过图小波特征显著改进了GNN的校准性能，适用于不同规模和密度的图。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个可扩展的、模型无关的数据估值框架，通过MMD度量训练数据与参考集之间的分布差异，高效准确地评估数据点的影响力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法存在偏差、计算成本高或近似误差大的问题，KAIROS旨在解决这些不足。

Method: KAIROS基于MMD（最大均值差异）为每个数据点分配分布影响力分数，无需重新训练，支持在线更新。

Result: KAIROS在噪声、错误标签和投毒基准测试中优于现有方法，速度提升高达50倍。

Conclusion: KAIROS提供了一种高效、准确的数据估值方法，具有理论保证和实际应用优势。

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度预测编码网络在超过五到七层时性能显著下降的问题，探索其根本原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 引入两种优化潜在变量的方法（精度加权）和新的权重更新机制，以减少深层误差累积。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，改进后的方法显著提升了深层网络的测试准确率，性能与反向传播相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，理解放松阶段对训练大规模平衡传播模型至关重要，为复杂任务中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和关于SAEs的争议，明确其适用场景。

Method: 提出概念区分，将现有负面和正面结果分开。

Result: SAEs适用于ML可解释性、公平性、审计、安全及社会科学和健康科学。

Conclusion: SAEs在发现未知概念方面具有独特优势，适合特定应用场景。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在线学习数据生成过程的正常行为并动态适应行为变化的框架，以准确识别异常点模式。

Method: 引入了一种新的随机有限集后验分布类别（Power Discounting Posteriors），通过新的预测后验密度函数实现数据系统性变化的适应和异常检测。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量模拟实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效区分正常和异常数据，并动态适应行为变化，为异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based agents enable universal interoperability, disrupting closed platforms by making data exchange cheaper and unavoidable, though it introduces new risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominance of closed, proprietary platforms in the application layer limits data exchange and interoperability, reinforcing monopolistic behaviors.

Method: Proposes using LLM-based agents to automatically translate data formats and interact with human-designed interfaces, enabling seamless data exchange.

Result: Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic practices and promotes data portability but introduces security risks and technical debt.

Conclusion: The ML community should embrace this shift while developing frameworks to mitigate risks, leveraging AI to restore user freedom and market competition.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SGD在自适应预处理下的收敛性，填补理论空白，并为Adam等算法的实际效率提供理论解释。

Method: 开发了一个统一的收敛分析框架，适用于多种自适应梯度方法（如AdaGrad-Norm、AdaGrad、ASGO/One-sided Shampoo），并分析了Scion和DASGO的理论联系。

Result: 证明了AdaGrad和DASGO等方法的收敛速度可以通过Nesterov动量加速，超越了已知的最佳速率。

Conclusion: AdaGrad型算法可以同时受益于对角预处理和动量，这为Adam等算法的实际效率提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

Result: 模型性能优于仅监督基线，并能与其他半监督方法结合进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，为半监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Motivation: 足球战术分析需要准确识别球队阵型和球员位置，现有方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用预定义的静态阵型模板，通过线性分配优化球员位置匹配，最小化实际位置与模板位置的距离，并引入稳定性参数减少不必要的阵型变化。

Result: EFPI能有效识别阵型，支持不同时间段的扩展分析，并已开源。

Conclusion: EFPI为足球战术分析提供了一种灵活且准确的阵型识别方法。

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical
analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for
formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal
tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to
optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能从数十亿候选顺序中找到学习友好顺序，并在乘法任务中复现了先前研究的逆序数字顺序。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能有效优化Transformer在算术任务中的学习顺序。

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Result: 结果表明，强化学习方法能有效实现流动收敛，提高工艺控制和产品质量。

Conclusion: 强化学习策略在复合材料制造中具有改进工艺控制和产品质量的潜力。

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘语言社区提供了实用的医疗信息访问工具。

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Motivation: 现有在线修复方法缺乏通用性和适应性，且过于保守，无法有效解决安全风险。

Method: ADReFT结合了基于Transformer的模型，通过状态监控和决策适配器生成适应性修复动作，并采用监督学习和强化学习进行训练。

Result: ADReFT在修复性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ADReFT是一种有效的修复方法，能够提升自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，神经网络的认证鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法因非凸性和全局半定规划（SDP）导致可扩展性差。

Method: 通过环路变换重新参数化网络，提出凸可接受条件，并采用随机子空间线性矩阵不等式（RS-LMI）分解全局约束。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet上实现了竞争性精度，显著改善了Lipschitz边界和运行时性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为认证鲁棒性提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

Method: TTA-VLM实现了8种情景TTA和7种在线TTA方法，统一评估15个数据集，并扩展到SigLIP模型和训练时调优方法。

Result: 实验发现：1）现有TTA方法改进有限；2）与训练时调优方法协作不佳；3）精度提升常以模型可信度降低为代价。

Conclusion: TTA-VLM为TTA方法提供了公平比较和全面评估，鼓励开发更可靠和通用的策略。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践中均表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为扩散模型加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:
